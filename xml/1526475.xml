    <AbstractNarration>Temperature perception has been studied infrequently in haptics because it is a much slower sense than tactile perception and also because temperature sensations are confounded by tactile perceptions. Yet, this tight coupling to other senses is precisely why it is important to study. Skin temperature alters the perception of tactile cues, is related to one's emotions, influences core body temperature, and affects physical performance. This project will expand our fundamental knowledge about how the human sensorimotor system perceives temperatures and how these temperatures couple with emotions. Project outcomes will separate thermal perception from the reality of temperature change. This in turn will transform our understanding of thermal regulation systems in the body and connections between temperature and psychological state, thereby enabling improvements in virtual reality enhanced interventions for anxiety disorders (such as post-traumatic stress disorder), for increased human performance under stress (e.g., first responders and athletes), and for numerous other applications which could benefit from more realistic virtual environments (e.g., therapy, training, entertainment). While such virtual reality has been feasible in the visual, auditory, and tactile modalities for decades, this work represents a transformative opportunity in the thermal regime. In conjunction with this research, the PI will develop a haptic demonstration and exhibit for installation at the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) in Tampa, Florida, which will teach visitors about haptics in general, including thermal perception, and the related areas of neuroscience, psychology, and system engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to understand temperature inputs applied over both localized and large areas of the skin and how they affect emotional responses, particularly when each input is changing over time. Temperature perception is known to be highly nonlinear; faster changes are perceived at lower thresholds than slower rates of change. The PI will evaluate how this nonlinear characteristic affects the perception of multiple temperature inputs in small and large regions of the skin. For example, this nonlinear perception could enable the sensation of a constantly changing temperature, but without affecting an overall skin temperature change. The PI will employ multiple thermal actuators, with a few getting hotter quickly and most cooling slowly. The slowly-decreasing actuators will be below the perceptual threshold and will not be perceived, but the quickly-increasing actuators will be perceived; thus, there will be a feeling of increasing temperature, but with no net change. The PI's preliminary studies show that this effect can be partially felt at the small scale, but he believes the effect will be more pronounced when larger skin areas are covered. When covering larger areas of skin with thermal actuators, he will also test how multiple thermal actuators are integrated into a single perception and how temperature affects emotional changes (e.g., "hot under the collar" and "a chill down the spine").</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Working memory, a critical cognitive function, is a strong predictor of academic, professional, and overall life achievement. Individuals differ greatly in their working memory abilities and such variation could be due to conditions that tax the working memory system, such as stress. Research examining the influence of stress on cognition through the presentation of negative feedback, however, has yielded conflicting results. With the help of Dr. Qiong Zhang at Zhejiang University, the current proposal examines how individual differences such as appraisal of negative feedback mediate the relationship between stress and working memory function. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project examines how one?s appraisal of feedback influences their performance. Individual differences in response to feedback could be rooted in the stress perception. Fundamental to the perspective of psychological stress is the perception and evaluation of potential harm posed by the stressor. Thus, psychological stress is solely determined by the persons? interpretations of the situation and not by objective appraisal of the environmental experiences. In the proposed study, subjects will be assigned to one of two conditions where they will be given positive or negative fictitious feedback on the working memory task irrespective of their actual performance. The influences of this feedback on working memory performance will be examined by assessing individual variables that may predict whether a stressor is perceived as a threat or a challenge. Amongst others, one such variable could be cultural background as previous research has indicated differences between East Asian and Western cultures in response to feedback. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

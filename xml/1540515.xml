    <AbstractNarration>For the 2013-2014 school year, the U.S. Department of Education identified statewide shortages of Mathematics and Science teachers in Oklahoma, continuing the pattern of shortages in at least one of these disciplines that has recurred annually for the past two decades. This Noyce Scholarship program at Oral Roberts University, Math and Science Scholarships for Teaching (MASST), will produce 26 highly qualified secondary math or science teachers from STEM disciplines who commit to teaching in a secondary high-need school. The project will partner with two of the largest school districts in the state of Oklahoma, Tulsa Public Schools, and Broken Arrow Public Schools, as well as the Tulsa Dream Center (a non-profit community center). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MASST Scholars will receive research-based, specialized training in high-need pedagogy that will be in practice throughout matriculation as the Scholars participate in multiple early experiences in high-need educational settings. The program will also support internships for 32 STEM students recruited from both ORU and Tulsa Community College (TCC) who will closely work with high-need students at the Tulsa Dream Center. A community of teacher learners will serve as a support system for the Scholars once they graduate from ORU, providing curriculum and pedagogical support for the new teachers during their induction years. The MASST Program proposes to advance knowledge and understanding within STEM education by applying Hollins' research methodology to the secondary areas of science and mathematics to determine if the specialized training in structured dialogue with contextualized practice in high-need schools increases the length of time that graduates teach in high-need schools. Scholars from underrepresented populations will be recruited from current ORU STEM majors and from students at TCC, thereby broadening participation of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

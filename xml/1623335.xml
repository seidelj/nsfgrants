    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Morgan State University seeks to infuse critical thinking and other evidence-based strategies throughout the introductory computer science programming course taken annually by about 100 students. A strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the specific goals to: integrate and evaluate critical thinking skills with the existing curriculum alongside programming skills; teach general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning of the curriculum; put greater emphasis on core computer science principles with less of a focus on syntax by introducing Python as the introductory programming language; incorporate visual and interactive learning; and actively engage students in collaborative learning. The desired outcome is to retain more students in the Computer Science major and to prepare them for graduate studies and/or the workforce.</AbstractNarration>

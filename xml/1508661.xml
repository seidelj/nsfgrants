    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Molecular nanomagnets are nanometer scale magnets that produce a large magnetic field. Because of the quantum nature in their magnetism and capability to tune their magnetic properties, molecular nanomagnets are promising materials for future applications of nano-scale magnetic storage and quantum information processing devices. This project entails a research plan that integrates the investigation and control of quantum memory time, known as quantum decoherence time, in molecular nanomagnets with innovative inter-disciplinary educational and outreach activities centered at the University of Southern California (USC). The research activities focus on revealing the origin of quantum decoherence in molecular nanomagnets using unique magnetic resonance techniques to significantly improve quantum coherence. Furthermore, the project incorporates educational activities including research training and curriculum developments for USC graduate and undergraduate students as well as science experiences and outreach activities for high school and elementary school students in the neighborhood community of USC with a high concentration of under-represented population in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to investigate and control quantum coherence in molecular nanomagnets. Quantum decoherence has become one of the most pressing problems in many solid-state spin systems. Among the solid-state systems, molecular nanomagnets are excellent testbed for understanding nanomagnetism and for applications to dense magnetic storage and quantum spintronics devices because of their nanoscale size, quantum nature in the magnetism, physical and chemical stability, and capability to tune the magnetic properties and couplings to surrounding environments. In this research project, the principle investigator plans to investigates the nature of quantum decoherence in molecular magnets using novel magnetic resonance techniques to demonstrate long quantum coherence. Success in the proposed work will provide a promising pathway for developing molecular nanomagnets with desired coherent properties and setting a general platform for future science on molecular nanomagnet-based spin devices. Furthermore, the project incorporates educational activities including research training and curriculum developments for USC graduate and undergraduate students as well as science experiences and outreach activities for high school and elementary school students in the neighbourhood community of USC with a high concentration of under-represented population in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

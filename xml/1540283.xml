    <AbstractNarration>Many computer scientists have realized that, in order to productively model and study the Internet and its novel computational phenomena, they need models and insights from disciplines such as game theory and economic theory, while many economists have found that a computational point of view is essential in order to understand a world in which markets are networked and the default platforms of economic transactions are algorithmic. Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT) stands at the intersection of these two fields. It has had significant practical impact, in a broad range of applications including online, matching and assignment markets, internet advertising, information diffusion, airport security, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will showcase the impact ofÂ  AGT on practice, and explore avenues for increasing the field's practical impact, including connections to machine learning, data science, and financial markets.</AbstractNarration>

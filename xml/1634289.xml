<AbstractNarration>Despite great progress over recent decades there is still much room for improvement in our understanding of the generation, propagation and dissipation of ocean surface waves and their role in coupling the atmosphere and the ocean. The momentum and energy fluxes from the atmosphere to the ocean are a function of the directional wave spectra and wave breaking distributions. The air-sea transfer of greenhouse and other gases depend on air entrainment due to breaking. The primary aims of this project are to better understand how currents modulate surface waves, and how surface waves transfer momentum to currents, especially through breaking by conducting an experiment combining state-of-the-art airborne measurements of waves, wave breaking, sea surface temperature and surface currents with in-situ measurements of the lower atmosphere and upper ocean from wave gliders and the Ocean Observatories Initiative's (OOI) Pioneer Array on the New England shelf. These new observations will then be used to test and improve wave models. Improvements in these surface-wave and current models will have a significant impact on society through improvements in coupled atmosphere-ocean models used for weather and climate prediction. Imagery from the aircraft and data from the Wave Gliders will be made available in almost real time for use in the classroom and for outreach to school students through the Birch Aquarium at Scripps. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students at UCSD during the academic year and summers. Conducting the experiment in the Pioneer Array will also provide access to the OOI Education Portal which will enhance the educational opportunities well beyond Scripps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project expands on the significant advances in measuring, modeling, and understanding, the kinematics and dynamics of ocean surface waves and their role in air-sea interaction made by the principal investigator in the last decade by considering the role of currents on the waves, and waves on the currents. Airborne remote sensing will be used to accurately measure directional surface wave fields, surface currents, and breaking, in the area of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Array. The airborne measurements will be supported by the Pioneer Array measurements of the air-sea fluxes of momentum and energy, and profile measurements of temperature, salinity and currents through the water column. The array data will be supplemented by two Wave Gliders instrumented to measure the lower atmospheric boundary layer and the upper 50 m of the water column. Sonic anemometers on the Wave Gliders will measure the Reynolds stress, or momentum flux, in the atmosphere. The 4- and 5-beam acoustic Doppler current profilers on the Wave Gliders will enable measurements of the Reynolds stresses in the water column, and the correlation of breaking at the surface with bursts in the Reynolds stresses. The evolution of the wave field will be modeled using the WAVEWATCH III framework. The wave modeling will be supported with ocean currents synthesized by a data assimilating regional ocean model of the southern New England shelf, the area of the Pioneer Array produced by an NSF-funded scientist at Rutgers University. While the field component of the project is site-specific to make use of the Pioneer Array data, the applications of the research will be global and are expected to lead to significant improvements in understanding and modeling ocean surface waves and currents.</AbstractNarration>

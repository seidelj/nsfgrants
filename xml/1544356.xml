    <AbstractNarration>Documenting, understanding, and predicting how organisms respond to natural and anthropogenic change is complicated; some responses may be short-term, but others may result from evolutionary change. This project will exploit long-term ecological data to ask when, where, and how often changes observed in aquatic organisms represent true evolutionary responses. Its value lies in the use and analysis of existing data to ask new questions about the nature of ecological changes over time. The University of Texas at Arlington is an Hispanic Serving Institution; groups under-served in STEM areas comprise 42% of the student population. The investigator will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the research activities, with clear plans to recruit students from under-served groups. He will use his analyses and resulting data in undergraduate inquiry-based laboratory exercises to demonstrate how to distinguish ecological from evolutionary responses and to extend his mentoring of under-served groups. Existing outreach programs at his institution will allow him to engage high school students in summer research activities. Through public outreach programs, he will increase awareness of the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to anthropogenic change and the importance of long-term research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites have documented responses of natural populations and communities to rising temperatures, increased urbanization, eutrophication, and the spread of exotic species, but have not examined the extent to which these responses reflect evolutionary change. The five aims comprising this project will quantify phenotypic responses to long-term ecological change, using phenotype as a signal for evolutionary responses. Existing data, samples, and experiments from over twenty lakes in Wisconsin and Alaska will be analyzed to explore changes in zooplankton traits that might indicate evolutionary responses to invasive species, land use change, rising temperatures, and changes in nutrient availability. Appropriate data sets and samples to address these questions have been identified, although some questions will require new measurements from archived specimens. Preliminary analyses are provocative. In some cases, changes in zooplankton body sizes and abundances support predator-induced selection. In other cases, they contradict predictions from prevailing theory. Exploratory statistical analyses will be used throughout to relate changes in response variables to putative selection pressures. Results will allow the tempo and trajectory of phenotypic change to be compared across sites to ask whether similar responses occur in temperate and arctic ecosystems. The investigator is an early-career researcher; his longer-term goal is to build these exploratory studies into a research program that integrates long-term ecological and evolutionary studies.</AbstractNarration>

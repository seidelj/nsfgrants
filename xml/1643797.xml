    <AbstractNarration>Texas A&amp;M International University (TAMIU), an Hispanic Serving Institution implements the College of Arts &amp; Sciences Community-aid (CASC-Aid) project in which 18 academically talented students with financial need majoring in Mathematics, Mathematics Education, Physical Science, Pre-Engineering, and Systems Engineering receive up to $6,800 for the academic year. In addition to offering financial assistance, CASC-aid addresses issues such as mathematics anxiety by providing an opportunity for scholars to share their previous math experiences and by offering Learning Support, an alternative to traditional recitation that engages learners in real-world applications and anticipates common misconceptions for those in early college math courses. Other components of the project include professor-led Community Tutoring; Success Workshops that cultivate mentoring; and, events and resources such as career guidance, advising, and field trips. The CASC-aid project will advance knowledge and understanding through a multifaceted evaluation plan and the investigation of research questions related to Learning Support, mathematics anxiety, and mindset. It will increase the number and promote the teaching of underrepresented and underserved students in STEM disciplines due to the investigation of the impact of each component with respect to TAMIU's undergraduate student population that is 59% female, 95% Hispanic, 57% low-income, and 57% first-generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The College of Arts &amp; Sciences Community-aid (CASC-Aid) project consists of a primary intervention, Learning Support, with My Math Story plus Introduction/Welcome Letter used for recruitment and retention, as a second intervention strategy. From prior research and teaching experiences, Learning Support is anticipated to be the most effective intervention. Multiple research questions are included where the outcomes or statistical findings can be converted to effect sizes for practical interpretation to determine which intervention strategy is most effective. The effect sizes from the Learning Support and My Math Story outcomes in the research questions will be computed to a d effect size measure. Effects sizes permit placing statistical results (F-test, t-test, chi-square, z-test) on the same reference scale. The CASC-aid project has the potential to significantly advance knowledge and understanding through the multifaceted evaluation plan and the investigation of research questions related to Learning Support, mathematics anxiety, and mindset. The goals and scope of the CASC-aid project are to develop, implement, and evaluate a program that fosters a community of academic success for Hispanic STEM students by enveloping mathematics courses with academic and student support services.</AbstractNarration>

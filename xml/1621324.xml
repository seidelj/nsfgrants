    <AbstractNarration>The creation and dissemination of new and useful research tools and data is critical to scientific progress. This workshop will bring together groups from such diverse and varied science research domains as biomedicine, physical sciences, computer science, linguistics, information science, and the social sciences to collectively discuss areas of interest, share findings and methods, and coordinate future goals and planning related to improving the norms and practices for scientific software and data citation and attribution. This work will contribute to properly recognizing and rewarding those who create and add value to the data and software tools relied on in scientific research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in this workshop hail from highly diverse and scientifically distinct areas and fields of research, and as such, have relatively few opportunities to interact face-to-face to share ideas, exchange knowledge and coordinate efforts. This workshop will offer an opportunity for cross-domain coordination, interaction and collaboration between a diverse set of researchers committed to the common goal of improving the systems and methods of citation and attribution of scientific software and data. Workshop participants will engage in extensive attendee-wide discussions on topics related to tools and resources, cross-domain convergence of efforts, and previous and ongoing community efforts regarding software and data citation in science research. Participants will also engage directly with external experts invited to give their perspectives and facilitate community discussion. Written reports suitable for publication from all sessions and panels will be prepared by meeting participants at the culmination of the workshop.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>What determines the frictional strength of a fault and how is fault slip distributed in space and time? The focus has long been on the rapid accumulation of slip and stress release from earthquake-generating dynamic ruptures with the interseismic period being seen as one of relative quiescence; however, recent observations of and indications for slow, aseismic slip has raised fundamental questions on the operation of faults throughout the seismic cycle. What proportion of relative motion across major faults occurs as such slow slip; how does it accommodate the release and transfer of stress along a fault; what permits this stable, yet accelerated, rate of slip and its migration; and what may be inferred about the forcing or about the fault or bulk rheology from observations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent work, the researcher has advanced a quantitative understanding of how slow fault slip may be initiated and propagated as a response to different forcing conditions. We find the existence of analytical solutions for slow, stable fault slip in response to principal driving factors such as sudden steps of stress on a fault, regions freely accommodating elevated rates of fault slip, and fluid sources. The novel analytical approach provides several avenues to identify fault operation on the basis of remote and local observations. These include data from recent field borehole experiments monitoring fluid injection and aseismic fault displacement, as well as geodetic and seismological inference of slow slip migration and moment release rates. Such observations will be directly compared with solutions of the type described above to determine whether the coupling of fault friction, elasticity, and a forcing condition is sufficient to account for observed behavior; and, if so, the inference of frictional parameters, spatiotemporal evolution of slip, and first-order characteristics of the driving factors. Further development of the analytical solutions and comparison with field observations will benefit from international collaborations with faculty at MINES ParisTech and Universit√© Nice Sophia Antipolis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Appealing to a common problem of identifying simple, yet fundamental, scalings arising from the interplay of mechanisms, the PI will develop a series of experimental demonstrations to excite STEM interest in middle and high school students. The development will be done in collaboration with undergraduate students at Tufts University, who will in turn engage middle and high school students through in-class experiments. The experiments will serve as both demonstrations and exercises in quantitative observation of phenomena, permitting comparisons with theoretical models. The demonstrations will subsequently be adapted for undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>

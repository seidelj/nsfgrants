    <AbstractNarration>#1510996&lt;br/&gt;Law, Chung K. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Princeton Summer School is to provide the next generation of combustion researchers and graduate students with a comprehensive knowledge in the technical areas of combustion theory, chemistry, experiment, computation and applications. For the past five years, each summer school session has offered several daily morning and afternoon three-hour lectures taught at an accelerated pace over five days. The program typically consists of the foundational courses of combustion chemistry and combustion theory, as well as enrichment courses such as engine combustion and laser diagnostics. The feedback from past participants has been uniformly enthusiastic for the learning and networking experience. The proposed support for graduate students and post-doctoral researchers is to offset part of the cost for travel and lodging (on Princeton's campus) at the 2015 Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion. The "camp" environment provides ample opportunities for students to interact intimately with established researchers as well as among themselves. Such a learning opportunity is usually not offerred on a campus and should help to develop the next-generation leader in combustion research and applications fields for the nation.</AbstractNarration>

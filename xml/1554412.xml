    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is a new class of decision models capable of harnessing the power of uncertain social data for disaster response logistics planning. Information critical in planning logistics activities to support disaster response has traditionally been gathered via time-consuming efforts such as on the ground assessments. The use of social media during emergencies enables collecting a larger amount of potentially life saving information in a shorter amount of time. Many emergency managers have indicated their agency would take action on social data only after verifying it. This strategy contradicts the timeliness of social data; one of its primary advantages. The products of this research will directly address concerns over the usefulness of social data in decision making by quantifying the value of considering the information at various stages of verification. Results will be translated to the first responder community via a simulated game to provide a comparative demonstration of response planning with and without social data. New generations of engineers will be inspired to pursue careers in humanitarian logistics and infiltrate the field with social data concepts by integrating games and case studies into courses and summer programs and involving students in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel models for uncertainty in real-time logistics planning will be developed that contribute to dynamic and stochastic routing in a number of ways. First, traditional assumptions of homeostatic probability distributions for modeled random variables do not hold, as crowdsourcing efforts constantly provide new information regarding the relative degree of belief in the accuracy of uncertain social data. Second, the models will allow timely action on uncertain requests instead of delaying resource allocation until the complete demand scenario is known. Sampling methods to account for these differences will be developed. Seminars and expert interviews with the first responder community will be conducted to select relevant routing problem variants and information formats. These activities will also determine a set of social data logistics strategies of practical interest to emergency managers, defined as policies that specify to what extent social data should be incorporated in a response plan. Developed models will be used to assess strategy performance across a diverse set of test instances based on real disasters. This will result in the identification of scenarios where social data integration can improve response efficacy, potentially transforming disaster response with methods that enable serving (saving) a larger number of needs (lives) in a shorter amount of time.</AbstractNarration>

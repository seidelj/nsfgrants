<AbstractNarration>iBiology is a web-based video collection for the life sciences community, which provides a window into the process of scientific discovery. iBiology's mission is to make recorded scientific talks by the world's leading biologists available on-demand and free-of-charge. iBiology's primary audience ranges from undergraduates to professional scientists, although iBiology's resources are also being used by high school students. In this project, iBiology will expand its offerings to produce 40 life sciences research talks per year, run a competition for young scientists to receive training and record their own iBiology talk, and produce a new series covering research techniques. A "flipped" course for use by educators will be produced each year. iBiology provides high schools, community colleges, and liberal arts colleges with access to high-level biology learning resources, thereby helping their faculty both to learn themselves and to teach their students. iBiology actively seeks to engage diverse national and international communities in the exciting future of biology through outreach and volunteer activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project iBiology will produce the following resources: iBioSeminars (research talks given by leading scientists); Discovery talks (short talks that cover famous discoveries); a Technique Series; "Flipped Courses" (courses will be produced on subjects where there is a need and the content is not found online or commonly taught in universities) and other Education Resources (activities or materials to accompany videos); and The Young Scientist Series (a competition highlighting work from talented young graduate students and postdoctoral fellows).</AbstractNarration>

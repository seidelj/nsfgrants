    <AbstractNarration>A non-technical description of the project that explains the significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exceptionally severe storms in 2013-2014 transported very large boulders (50-430 metric tons) on Ireland's Aran Islands. Some of these boulders were tens of meters above sea level and some were hundreds of meters inland. This project will analyze these boulders together with meteorological information, numerical modeling, and physical modeling in a scaled wave tank, to detail the relationships between wave energy and the movement of heavy objects.This research will train undergraduate and graduate earth scientists in analysis of coastal erosion. School groups from the field locations in Ireland will be involved in the project as citizen scientists, and the results will be communicated to both professional organizations and local communities. The project will establish a predictive relationship between storm-wave power and the inland extent of boulder movement that can serve as an index of the destructive power of storms, which will be of value to coastal communities, policy makers, and coastal engineers as part of long-term coastal hazard assessment. This project is part of the US-Ireland Research and Development Partnership program and it is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three goals, which will be carried out via collaboration with researchers in Ireland. The first goal is to map topography and bathymetry of Ireland's Aran Islands, to collect pressure data from submerged sensors that will monitor wave heights in real time, and to continue monitoring year-to-year movement of coastal boulders. The second is to numerically model wave height augmentation in the coastal zone, to understand how storm waves are amplified to the point where they can move very large masses at great heights and distances inland. The third goal is to create a scaled wave-tank experiment combining the field measurements and numerical models, to provide additional constraints on physical processes happening as waves impact the shoreline. This integrated approach will provide an accurate assessment of near-shore high-energy processes that could be used to forecast inshore propagation of wave energy for specific sea states and coastal bathymetry.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will observe, in fine detail, nearby dwarf galaxies and globular clusters in the Milky Way. The investigators have previously measured the dark matter content in some dwarf galaxies and compared their observations to numerical models. Their results are in better agreement with models than previous observations. The investigators will use a new, very sensitive, spectrograph, which can measure the velocities of stars in these galaxies and clusters with great precision. Their observations are important because understanding the dark matter content of dwarf galaxies is critical for testing of models of the universe as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators directly focus on observational studies of low dispersion systems in the cold dark matter paradigm. There has been a problem in comparing these systems with numerical simulations over the past 30 years, typically referred to as the core/cusp problem, the missing satellite problem, and the "too big to fail" problem. The investigators aim to resolve each of these issues with this study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scientific advancement, the investigators are also committed to engaging the public with these studies. The investigators are designing an exhibit connecting the topic of dark matter with the optical instruments used in their research. Their presentations will engage and educate the general public, which includes a large number of Spanish speakers that live in or near West Texas.</AbstractNarration>

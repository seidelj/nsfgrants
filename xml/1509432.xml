    <AbstractNarration>1509432 (Mason)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an emerging gaseous fuel combustion method in which carbon dioxide (CO2) can be separated from other components in the flue gas, enabling a low-cost and efficient separation and capture of CO2. The potential success of this project will help avoid negative impact on the earth's atmosphere and climate. The proposed activities will also promote training and learning activities by involving undergraduate and graduate students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge gap is known to exist among molecular-level details about the surface science of oxygen carriers of CLC. While candidate batch studies have helped identify carriers, details of structure-reactivity relationships and the intermediate heterogeneous steps involved in the fuel oxidation are yet unknown. The proposed study aims to enhance the understanding of the fundamental reaction mechanisms involved in important heterogeneous processes of CLC and related catalytic applications. The thermodynamic stability of oxygen carriers will be assessed through experimental and theoretical methods and trends between carrier structure, composition, durability, and reactivity will be identified. The knowledge thus gained may drive the future rational design of materials for CLC and related applications. The methane fuel and its C-H bond activation related to many other reaction activities will be studied. Chemical synthesis and the replacement of petrochemical feed stocks by alkanes will also be investigated, expanding the potential impact of this project.</AbstractNarration>

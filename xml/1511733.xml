    <AbstractNarration>Chakrapani, 1511733&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water is a ubiquitous participant or bystander in many devices and both natural and man-made systems. Yet, its interactions with surfaces are not well understood and are frequently overlooked. This study provides detailed molecular-scale insight into the ways that water interacts with transition metal oxide surfaces particularly as it relates to the design and function of catalysts and electrochemical devices. The PI also uses her knowledge of electrochemistry to engage students at all levels in understanding sustainable technologies such as solar cells, environmental remediation and smart windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall project goal is to understand the nature of interactions between water and metal oxide surfaces, especially the role of defects in such interactions. A fourfold experimental approach will be used to 1) determine if the interactions are electrochemical in nature, 2) probe structural changes in hydrogen bonding of water adsorbed at the solid interface, 3) understand how water-induced defects influence redox couples, and 4) measure the changes in electrical properties associated with the adsorption of water. Several advanced characterization techniques will be employed, including high-resolution sum-frequency generation spectroscopy, in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy, and UV photoelectron spectroscopy. The resulting understanding will have application in areas as diverse as astrophysics, mineralogy, hydrology, catalysis, and sustainable technologies. With regard to the latter, the PI has developed a new course which teaches the fundamental aspects of electrochemistry and solid-state physics related to sustainable energy technologies, with simplified aspects made available to K-12 students via energy workshops, summer camps, and an interactive hands-on demo module.</AbstractNarration>

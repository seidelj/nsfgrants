    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Graduate Summer School in Modern Harmonic Analysis and Its Applications" that will be held July 20-August 7, 2015, at the College Park campus of the University of Maryland. This summer school for graduate students will focus on modern harmonic analysis and applications, specifically, topics from Fourier and time-frequency analysis, finite frame theory, sparse transforms, and geometric and analytic methods for modeling big data. The instruction comprises seven four-day-long lecture series, including a tutorial, supplemented by computer lab work. The objectives are to quickly review the fundamentals, focus on the developments of the last 10 years, and provide a glimpse of the state of current research and open problems. Most of this information is available only in the form of original research papers or preprints; the summer school is intended to make this material accessible to graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and other nonspecialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This summer school, which is jointly sponsored by the University of Maryland and the Institute for Mathematics and Its Applications (IMA) through the latter's IMA Participating Institution Graduate Student Summer Program, brings together some of the leading harmonic analysts in the U.S. to explore topics that lie at the heart of modern harmonic analysis. The primary topics of the courses (with the corresponding lecturers) are the following: Fourier analysis (John Benedetto); frames and time-freqency analysis (Chris Heil); preconditioning of finite frames (Kasso Okoudjou); nonlinear analysis with frames (Radu Balan); sparse Fourier transforms (Anna Gilbert); geometric and analytic methods for modeling data, and their application (Gilad Lerman); and harmonic analysis of big data (Wojtek Czaja).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summer School web site: www.norbertwiener.umd.edu/Education/IMA2015/</AbstractNarration>

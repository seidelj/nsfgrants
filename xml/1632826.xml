<AbstractNarration>Precision medicine is a new approach for disease therapy and prevention. It considers individual variability in genomics makeups, environment, and lifestyle in determining a more personalized treatment. As precision medicine heavily relies on individual genomics and proteomics markers for disease diagnosis and proper treatment selection, computation models and signal processing are important components. The PIs propose to organize the Workshop on Bioinformatics for Precision (the Workshop) in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important mission of the Workshop is to promote participation of graduate students, especially women and minority students, and foster student education on computational biology for precision medicine. This grant will be used to provide travel awards to qualified graduate students, whose papers are deemed of high quality, to support their participation in the conference. The Workshop organization includes the student award committee, which will be responsible for evaluation and selection of student awardees. Particularly, 20-30% of the awards will be allocated to encourage women and minority students to participate and submit papers to the Workshop.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to provide a unique platform for the bioinformatics and computational biology researchers in especially IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) and Signal Processing Society to interact and exchange research ideas among them and with others in Biomedical and Health Informatics community and discuss future challenges in Precision Medicine. As integrated bioinformatics and medical informatics approaches become one of the focus areas in Precision Medicine, this workshop is uniquely positioned to spark novel ideas and promote new collaborations between researchers in these two communities.  The theme of workshop will be precision medicine and will address the computational issues in precision medicine.</AbstractNarration>

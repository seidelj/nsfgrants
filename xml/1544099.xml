    <AbstractNarration>The funding from NSF will provide partial participants support at the 2015 Cyber Security Education Workshop organized by Georgia Tech and supported by Intel Corporation and NSF. The total attendance is expected to exceed 150 participants from organizations across the United States, Europe, Asia and South America. At the workshop, members of academia, industry, and government will collaborate to build upon ongoing security education programs and encourage the adoption, incorporation, and dissemination of security content into college curricula. The event will also explore broader dissemination of novel ideas and experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By fostering dialogue among academia, the private sector, government and international communities the workshop will significantly improve the collaboration among the sectors that will operate, sustain, and employ the persons and technology that underpin the essential core of the Nation?s critical infrastructure; the stronger partnerships between employers and academic institutions; and increased research activities to continue forward progress on relevant hard problems. Expected outcomes of the workshop include the generation of new ideas for security content adoption and collaborative initiatives among various faculty. If successful, the event will also enable the creation of additional security content integration examples that facilitate learning at both two- and four-year colleges.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Fifth Annual Mid-Atlantic Regional Joint Mathematics Conference, held at George Mason University, March 20-21, 2015. The goals of the conference are to (a) bring together students and experts in industry and academia; (b) provide undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral associates and new doctoral degree holders an opportunity to present their research in a professional conference setting; (c) foster interdisciplinary collaboration among research groups from both academia and industry; (d) encourage networking between students and industry professionals and; (e) increase student awareness of, and interest in, U.S. government and private industry careers. This conference will strengthen the connection between mathematical advances in industry, government agencies, and academia. Professionals from industry and government agencies, academicians, and students will benefit from the diverse collection of talks, focusing on real world problems as well as recent theoretical advances. The core participating universities for this conference are George Mason University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Shippensburg University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will focus on recent advances in applied mathematics, including optimal control theory, partial differential equations and the finite element method, computational topology, probability theory and stochastic processes, fluid dynamics, the modeling of materials, and machine learning. Additionally, the conference will feature talks concerning traditionally pure and applied areas of mathematics with emphasis on computational aspects of problem solving as well as education. The conference will help to prepare mathematical sciences students for careers in business, industry, and government. Industry participants will benefit from learning about cutting-edge academic advances and from access to highly-trained problem solvers, and students will benefit from exposure to real world problems, thus giving context to their areas of study. The broader impact of the conference is the increased collaboration between industry, government and academia. By bringing these diverse groups together, the meeting will foster the exchange of ideas on how to tackle new, complex problems. Additionally, the conference provides young academic researchers a chance to network with industry professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web page: sites.google.com/site/siammidatlantic</AbstractNarration>

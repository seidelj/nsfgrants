    <AbstractNarration>CBET - 1605584&lt;br/&gt;PI: Park, Keunhan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rate of radiative heat transfer can significantly exceed the expected rate when the gap between objects is smaller than the wavelength of the thermal radiation. This observation enables innovative technological applications such as near-field thermophotovoltaic power generation, thermal rectification and local radiative cooling. The objective of this project is the experimental validation of near-field thermal radiation, which is relatively unexplored, especially for gaps less than 10 nanometers. The outcome of this research will provide knowledge in the spectral distribution of thermal radiative energy and its transport in the extreme near-field regime. Results of the project will spark the development of detection, imaging and spectroscopy of mid-infrared light at the nanoscale as well as near-field thermophotovoltaic power generators. The project will promote training and learning through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the proposed research activities. Additionally, K-12 outreach will be performed via the Utah Science Olympiad, Engineering Day and Utah Nano Days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experimental and theoretical investigation of extreme near-field thermal radiation will be accomplished by: (1) measuring the extreme near-field radiative heat transport between a heated tip and a surface in an ultrahigh vacuum atomic force microscope (UHV-AFM); (2) measuring the near-field thermal spectrum via tip-enhanced photocurrent generation and tip-scattered thermal radiation; and (3) modeling tip-surface near-field thermal interactions via numerically exact and approximate methods. Innovative features of this project originate from using the tip-plane configuration in a customized UHV-AFM, which is interfaced with reflective optics that allows the measurement of tip-scattered thermal radiation in conjunction with direct tip-substrate thermal and radiative interactions. Home-built resistive nanothermometers and a customized photovoltaic mid-infrared detector will be implemented as a substrate to directly measure tip-substrate near-field energy transport. The obtained experimental data will be compared against the numerical model, called the thermal discrete dipole approximation, to understand the underlying mechanisms and factors affecting extreme near-field thermal radiation and radiation-to-conduction transition. This research will provide quantitative measurements of extreme near-field thermal radiation which will allow, in tandem with the theoretical models, the determination of the limit of applicability of the continuum theory based on fluctuational electrodynamics. In addition, an extensive spectroscopic analysis of near-field thermal radiation will shed light on understanding the near-field effects on the thermal radiation spectrum, including the potential spectral redshift when a tip is in near-field interactions with a substrate. The proposed theoretical work will overcome the challenge of the current point-dipole based tip-plane near-field thermal radiation model.</AbstractNarration>

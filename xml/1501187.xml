    <AbstractNarration>The tropical Andes provide a natural laboratory for biodiversity studies for many animal and plant groups, yet many of the endemic species are restricted to remote high-elevation areas that are poorly studied. One of these poorly-known groups is the lizard genus Liolaemus, and this project will use DNA sequences to: 1) propose a hypothesis of evolutionary relationships for one major subgroup of this genus (thought to contain ~ 45 species); and 2) evaluate alternative methods of delimiting species in a smaller species group of Liolaemus. For both objectives we will sample new geographic locations, and for the first time employ 'Next Generation' DNA sequencing technologies to collect large molecular data sets for the target groups, and newer statistical methods for resolving species boundaries based on multiple independent classes of data (morphology, ecology, DNA, etc.). These lizards will serve as model organisms for other biodiversity studies, and stimulate further field sampling and integrative taxonomic studies of the tropical Andean biota. Our study will reveal cryptic diversity, promote the discovery of the new species, and provide a better understanding of the region?s biodiversity. The description of new species will involve undergraduate student co-authors, while reconstruction of evolutionary relationships will serve as a framework for comparative studies of the evolution of viviparity in these lizards, and how they have colonized the harshest high-elevation Andean climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will generate new data via development of a large Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset, and employ new non-tree based species delimitation methods (SDL) to test alternative species hypotheses in the lizards of the Liolaemus robustus species group. This research will test SDL hypotheses based on mitochondrial (mt) DNA, morphological, and bioclimatic data. The project will test these alternatives with SNP data using a new Bayes factor SDL approach that does not require a guide tree, and compares across non-nested alternative models. This study will provide new knowledge about the evolutionary history of this particular clade of lizards, and test the utility of this approach in a poorly-known but biodiversity-rich part of South America. We will also develop the most complete phylogeny for the poorly-known Liolaemus montanus clade, based on the most extensive sampling of species and characters available to date.</AbstractNarration>

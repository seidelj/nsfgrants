    <AbstractNarration>Bennett College will test the development of a model by examining the synergistic impact of four interventions on the grade-point average (GPA), retention, and graduation rates on underrepresented minority students at a historically black women's college. The researchers also will measure the relationship between students' level of participation in the interventions and their perception of the effectiveness of these interventions, cumulative and major GPAs, and overall satisfaction level with the institution as measured by the National Survey of Student Engagement Inventory. The broad, long-term outcomes of the proposed project are to identify the mechanisms that increase the number of underrepresented minority women STEM graduates that may pursue graduate degrees and leadership positions in STEM and to develop a retention model that could be used to reduce attrition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use a cross-sectional and longitudinal research design to 1) assess the effects of the synchronized implementation of mandatory tutoring, supplemental instruction, faculty mentoring, and intrusive advising on the retention and graduation rates of underrepresented female STEM students and teacher education majors; 2) measure the impact of these interventions on the retention rates of current and potential STEM majors over a two-year period; and 3) determine whether these interventions might differentially impact the retention of high and low achieving students as measured by their GPA. A mixed-methods approach will be used to collect and analyze data from underrepresented minority female student participants and STEM faculty to assess their perceptions about the effectiveness of the intervention strategies on their retention and academic success.</AbstractNarration>

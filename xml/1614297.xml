<AbstractNarration>The project will investigate the different methods to grow materials needed for LED lighting and Power Electronics. The research will be conducted in collaboration with 2014 Nobel Prize Winner in Physics, Dr. Hiroshi Amano at the University of Nagoya. The collaboration provides direct insight into the state of art technology used to create advanced materials for future electronics. Understanding the method to grow complex materials will lead to the development of more efficient electronics used for lighting, electric vehicles and renewable energy. This will allow for more neighborhoods across the country to have light at night and ensuring a safer environment throughout the whole day. It will further reduce the nation?s overall power consumption making the country have a more sustainable future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of buffer layers and dislocations on the thermal properties associated with Gallium Nitride (GaN) based electronics. . The research will be conducted in collaboration with 2014 Nobel Prize Winner in Physics, Dr. Hiroshi Amano.  Group III-nitride semiconductors, such as GaN, have almost exclusively been grown on non-native substrates such as Silicon, Silicon Carbide. In order to accommodate the large lattice mismatch between GaN and non-native substrates, buffer layers have been used. The heterogeneous epitaxy of GaN, unfortunately, introduces defects that alter the material?s electrical and thermal properties. These defects have been suggested to decrease the layers? thermal conductivity, causing High Power Electronics to operate at higher temperatures and thus lead to failure. Previous research has shown that the growth conditions and type of buffer layers can reduce the amount of material defects. Successful implementations have varied the thickness or method of deposition of an aluminum nitride (AlN) buffer layer, or implemented a stripe pattern on sapphire designs. Very little research, however, has been conducted to determine what effect these techniques have on the thermal properties of the materials. The project will address this issue by material and basic device characterization of GaN samples grown on different substrates. Advanced microscopy, surface morphology, electrical characterization and laser based thermal metrology characterization methods will be used for this purpose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

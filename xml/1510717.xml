    <AbstractNarration>1510179(Gross) &amp; 1510717(Fasel)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to investigate the fluid dynamics processes that occur in solar chimney plants, in order to enable their use at a large scale. In solar chimney power plants, air under a circular collector is heated by the sun. The hot air rises through a central chimney and the resulting thermal convection drives turbines at the inflow to the chimney. Large-scale plants could provide electricity at a competitive cost, but the fluid dynamics involved are not well understood. Such research in energy generation is of National interest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fluid dynamics process that plays a dominant role here is the radial Rayleigh-Benard-Poiseuille flow. The proposed work is about understanding of the instabilities for inward and outward radial Rayleigh-Benard-Poiseuille flow that will advance the science of primary and secondary instability with convection, but in addition, this understanding can help the informed design of solar chimney power plants. As part of this research project the flow instabilities governing laminar, transitional, and turbulent inward radial Rayleigh-Benard-Poiseuille flow will be explored. Towards this end, computer simulations will be carried out for investigating the primary and secondary instabilities and their role in the evolution and dynamics of flow structures that affect both heat transfer and streamwise pressure drop in the collector. For the laminar and transitional regime, the simulation strategies will be validated by experiments using scientifically instrumented scaled solar chimney models. Once validated, the Reynolds number of the simulations will be increased to investigate the instabilities of the turbulent flow in full-size solar chimney collectors. Both the University of Arizona and New Mexico State University have a large body of Hispanic and Native American students who can form a diverse pool of candidate students who will work in this research. The project will allow the continuation of an already established high school outreach program. In addition, a website will be created to inform the public about the project, to post daily operating data of the demonstrator, and to share results with other researchers.</AbstractNarration>

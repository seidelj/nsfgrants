    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description: Many natural and biological processes, such as neural activity and energy transfer inside cells of living organism rely on the transport of hydrogen ions for proper functioning. This project develops a tool that enables the study of the fundamental aspects of hydrogen ion transport through very small channels that mimic nanoscale biological systems. Potential applications include new materials for efficient fuel cells, as well as devices that are capable of interfacing living biological systems with nanoscale electronic devices, for targeted diagnostics and therapies. The educational component of this project seeks to expand visual communication skills of students. In modern scientific research, graphics are regularly used to convey research findings among scientists and the general public. Teaching modules addressing graphical display of information are used to better prepare undergraduate and graduate students for future careers in science and engineering. Additionally, science students collaborate with art students to develop effective graphics for dissemination of scientific data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description: Proton transport in one dimension is very important in biological systems and for developing materials for separation science and energy applications. To date, it has been difficult to study proton transport in a perfect one dimensional system. This project aims to demonstrate proof-of-concept devices for studying one dimensional proton transport in hydrogen bonded water proton wires, by exploring water filled carbon nanotubes as one dimensional proton conductors. Water organized inside carbon nanotubes has remarkably interesting properties when it comes to proton conduction, with reported high conductivity and frictionless motion at short length scales. This proof-of-concept serves as a foundation for measuring the conductivity, charge carrier density, contact barrier and water organization, providing for the first time values for mobility of hydrogen and hydronium ions from transistor measurements. The enabler of these studies is a proton-field effect transistor incorporating a polymer proton filter for separating electronic contributions from the carbon nanotubes.</AbstractNarration>

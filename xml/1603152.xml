    <AbstractNarration>PI: Strachan, Douglas R. &lt;br/&gt;#: 1603152&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As future devices are reduced to the smallest nanometer sizes, material interfaces are expected to play an ever-greater role in determining their behaviors. At these ultra-small sizes, the precise ordering of the atoms at the interfaces is of critical importance for determining these nanoscale properties. A promising approach for controlling these precisely-ordered interfaces is to connect together the nanoscale materials the same way that lego toys are connected; i.e., with their periodic lattices snapped together. To make these nanoscale ?lego-snapped? interfaces of use requires that they be reproducibly and controllably achievable between technologically-relevant materials. Achieving this goal, however, requires a fundamental understanding and control of the relevant interactions at the interfaces of nanomaterials. As an important step in the long-term goal of understanding and controlling the relevant interactions at such interfaces, lego-snapping will be investigated between two of the most promising and important nanomaterials ? these being graphene and carbon nanotubes. The investigation of lego-snapping between these nanomaterials will be achieved in an innovative method that tunes the interactions between the graphene and the carbon nanotubes through the use of a third adjacent material. This innovative investigation should provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms of forming lego-snapped interfaces that could be of use in engineering nanoscale alignments with mass-scale reproducibility and specificity ? results that would be of tremendous technological use in the fabrication and synthesis of future nanoscale technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As nanoscale systems are reduced in size, the relative crystallographic orientations of materials? lattices should become increasingly important to their interfacial properties. Utilizing nanoscale components that consist of well-ordered lattice-matched nanomaterials is a novel and promising avenue for achieving these highly crystalline interfaces. Atomically-thin nanomaterial components, like carbon nanotubes and graphene that consist of the same lattice back-bone are ideal for achieving such lattice-matched interfaces. Moreover, the fact that these materials are atomically-thin permits a new innovative method for probing their interfaces via the use of additional adjacent ?substrate? materials. These adjacent ?substrate? materials will provide a route to control the localized strain of the nanotube-graphene system and, thus, provide a method to modify, probe, and enhance the lattice matching of their interface. Through the use of this external strain control, a fundamental understanding of the relevant interactions at the interfaces of these atomically-thin nanomaterial systems will be obtained.</AbstractNarration>

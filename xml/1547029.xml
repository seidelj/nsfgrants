    <AbstractNarration>In 2005, Presidential Science Adviser John Marburger catalyzed the development of a new field of research, the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP). This project will enhance the benefits of SciSIP research by providing a clearer understanding of the needs of science and innovation policy practitioners. This project will raise awareness of SciSIP research among practitioners, elicit the needs and priorities of practitioners to focus future research, and explore mechanisms for collaboration between SciSIP researchers and practitioners over the long run. The research agenda that flows from this project will strengthen science and innovation policy, advancing this field of social science research and improving effective decision-making about the nation?s science and innovation system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project elicits, specifies, and analyzes the needs and priorities of the users of the results of research on the Science of Science and Innovation Policy, such as policy analysts, advisers, and managers who work closely with senior decision-makers in U.S. science, technology, and innovation policy. By bringing together existing and potential consumers of science policy research, the project seeks to discover how the SciSIP portfolio might be improved. The project also considers institutional designs and strategies for incorporating user demand into the SciSIP agenda on an ongoing basis. This conference strengthens collaboration between SciSIP researchers and policy practitioners in research design and development of decision-support tools</AbstractNarration>

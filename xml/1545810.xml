    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the National Academy of Sciences' Government University Industry Research Roundtable to support activities of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative initiative among university research administrators, faculty and federal agency representatives. FDP, which currently consists of representatives from 154 academic institutions, 10 federal agencies and professional societies, offers a forum for members to improve the national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline and standardize research administration policies and procedures. During the current phase, FDP will develop and expand upon targeted demonstrations that address and provide guidance for several activities including: the implementation of streamlined data collection efforts associated with the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act; uniform guidance implementation planning on research terms and conditions and procurement standards to maintain effective stewardship of federal research; and the expansion of the Financial Conflict of Interest Clearinghouse that allows recipients of federal funds to verify compliance as part of the award process. FDP continues to improve the relationship between federal agencies and the research community, ensuring the efficiency and integrity of STEM research and education administration.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Scientists can rapidly obtain the DNA sequence of an individual, and find sites in the DNA that affect one trait. It is believed that many sites will affect more than one trait, a phenomenon called pleiotropy. The proportion of sites that are pleiotropic is not known, in part because how to find such sites is unclear. This project investigates the patterns of pleiotropy in a model organism to see whether those effects are typically restricted to one simple part of the body, or are likely to have effects on many different parts. If the team finds that a DNA change generally affects many traits, then this will suggest that those studying human genomes will have to look at diverse traits to understand how DNA changes affect specific aspects of heath. This project makes a fundamental contribution to our understanding of how genotypes map onto phenotypes. Additionally, the PIs will provide research opportunities for undergraduates in computational biology and will develop statistical software for the research community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To characterize pleiotropy, the scientific team will use the fruit fly because of its rapid generation time and low cost. They will develop methods to automate the measurement of multiple body parts, and then characterize these parts in a set of 200 fully sequenced fly stocks. They will develop statistical techniques to quantitatively characterize pleiotropy using these data. The data and statistical techniques will then be used to find the DNA sites that affect the shape of the body, and to determine whether those effects typically are restricted to one part of the body, or affect many parts. The statistical techniques to characterize pleiotropy developed in this project will apply directly to other species, including humans. This project also includes active collaboration with Norwegian scientists, including international training for US graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, which was partially funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

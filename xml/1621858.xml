    <AbstractNarration>Layered mafic intrusions are scientifically and economically important because they are the geological reservoir for 80% of the palladium and other platinum group elements that derives from high-risk jurisdictions, such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, or the Russian Federation. In the US, layered intrusions such as the Stillwater Complex, have supplied chromium ore and other economic resources over the years. These complexes constitute world class natural laboratories to train students in igneous petrology and economic geology. This award will support the travel and registration costs required for the participation of ten early-career scientists and graduate students in the Geological Society of America (GSA) Penrose Conference on 'Layered mafic intrusions and associated economic deposits' that will be held in Red Lodge, Montana, U.S.A. from August 8th to 12th, 2016. Advances in science often occur when scientists talk to each other, discuss their results and formulate new hypotheses. The format of GSA Penrose conferences provides the opportunity for in-depth interactions amongst participants for several days of focused discussion. National and international experts will interact with early-career scientists to brainstorm on new approaches and pressing questions regarding the origin, evolution and ore deposit formation of layered mafic intrusions. The conference also provides the best venue to allow the next generation of scientists to meet and interact with industry professionals in the area of ore genesis and exploration. Finally, it is expected that the conference will provide clarity on key topics primed for advance on understanding layered mafic intrusions over the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this Geological Society of America (GSA) Penrose conference are i) to explore recent advances in the petrology, geochemistry and economic geology of layered mafic intrusions; ii) to enhance the training of early-career and graduate scientists in any aspect of the geosciences pertaining to layered mafic intrusions; and iii) to define the key questions regarding layered mafic intrusions that need to be addressed in the coming decade. This award will provide support for ten early-career scientists to attend this conference.</AbstractNarration>

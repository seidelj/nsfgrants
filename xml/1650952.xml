    <AbstractNarration>Valorization is the process of transforming by-products and co-products into valuable products such as fine chemicals, materials (specifically polymer) and fuels. Waste valorization is based on the concept of circular economy and has attracted much attention in recent years with the aim of managing and reusing co-products that would otherwise end up in landfills. This conference is designed to spur discussions among food (agricultural and aquaculture) product manufacturers, biochemical industries, academia and foundations to systematically explore co-products available from various industrial sectors, the challenges in disposal, and opportunities for conversion of this waste into useful products while lowering environmental impact and/or toxicity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will serve as a platform to support the needs for this growing community of researchers working on the unique aspects of pre-consumer waste valorization. The conference will feature a workshop to discuss research priorities in the area of organic waste valorization and identify the steps necessary for the advancement of this topic. A conference website will be maintained and will act as the platform for further interaction and collaboration for developing ideas and research agenda in this area. The conference will be held at the University of Massachusetts - Lowell on December 12-13, 2016.</AbstractNarration>

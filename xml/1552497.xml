    <AbstractNarration>Ubiquitous sensing has enabled new services and applications that mark&lt;br/&gt;every aspect of our lives. However, the ensuing data deluge is a brick&lt;br/&gt;wall in face of our abilities to interpret, process and store data. Also, not&lt;br/&gt;all the data collected is informative, nor well-attuned to the tasks we&lt;br/&gt;care to accomplish. This project introduces new approaches for data&lt;br/&gt;processing that hold promise to bring about stunning speedups in the&lt;br/&gt;processing of massive data, and explores principled controlled data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition paradigms for numerous inference problems. The research&lt;br/&gt;activities are expected to advance the theory and practice of data&lt;br/&gt;processing and acquisition in emerging cyber-physical systems for civil&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, healthcare, energy, and transportation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves 1) developing, and analyzing the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;limits of, transformative subspace-based approaches to data processing&lt;br/&gt;that are simultaneously scalable and robust to outliers using subspace&lt;br/&gt;pursuit in structure-preserving data sketches, and data-subspace&lt;br/&gt;formulations which are invariant to transformations that preserve the&lt;br/&gt;underlying low-dimensional data structures, 2) exploring controlled data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition in asymptotic regimes of large number of observations with&lt;br/&gt;relaxed notions of optimality to unravel the complete structure of&lt;br/&gt;optimal design and recognize unifying principles for the design of&lt;br/&gt;efficient control policies for a host of controlled inference problems. The&lt;br/&gt;practical implications of the fundamental results are studied in the&lt;br/&gt;context of structural health monitoring for damage detection and&lt;br/&gt;characterization of engineering structures. The educational activities&lt;br/&gt;include establishing a new miniature sensing lab, developing an&lt;br/&gt;introductory course on learning from big data and sequential analysis,&lt;br/&gt;compiling a corpus of intuitive tutorials laying out the core concepts of&lt;br/&gt;research results, and mentoring of senior design projects.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division Dr. Catherine Royer from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) is characterizing RNA. RNA is thought to be the original central molecule of early life forms. Understanding what controls the structure and dynamics, and thus function, of RNA molecules is key to piecing together how life began and evolved on earth. Pressure changes are used to induce changes in RNA structure, opening an entirely new avenue of biochemical research. Pressure is particularly appropriate because life is thought to have evolved in the oceans, and thus under pressure. The research involves promotion of scientific fields to high school students via participation in the high school student mentoring program at RPI's Center for Biotechnology. Graduate and undergraduate students are being trained in state-of-the-art biophysical chemistry. Women and underrepresented minorities are being promoted in STEM research, through the undergraduate Summer Research Program in biochemistry and biophysics at RPI. This program hosts undergraduates from primarily minority-serving colleges. International internship opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students are being provided through strong international network of collaborators in France, Germany and Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global objective of the research is to structurally and energetically characterize tertiary conformational transitions of structured RNA molecules using high hydrostatic pressure. Pressure effects on biopolymer conformational equilibria are due to differences in molar volume between states, which for RNA, arise from differences in voids and hydration effects. Pressure perturbation of RNA allows quantitative assessment of the changes in hydration and ion condensation implicated in RNA structural dynamics. Two well-characterized model RNA systems are investigated; tRNALys3 and the Azoarcus group I ribozyme, using a combination of NMR, fluorescence, FTIR and SAXS. Research is aimed specifically at determining the structural and dynamic effects of pressure on these model RNA molecules, the quantitative contributions of hydration and ion interactions to the structural transitions and the role of conserved nucleotides in controlling RNA conformational transitions.</AbstractNarration>

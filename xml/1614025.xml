    <AbstractNarration>Invasive species are a global concern, causing substantial environmental and economic losses worldwide, and international partnerships are critical for the research and effective management of invaders. Mycorrhizae are a ubiquitous symbiotic relationship between plant roots and fungus that is mutually beneficial to both organisms. Mycorrhizal fungi are likely critical in determining the potential range of an invasive species. The geographic distribution patterns of mycorrhizae, while poorly understood, could be important in determining the mechanisms of invasive success. Lodgepole pine, an obligately mycorrhizal and economically important timber crop, is native to western North America and a significant invasive species in much of the southern hemisphere. This project will implement parallel analyses between the western North America native and New Zealand invaded ranges to provide insight into the origin, dispersal, and distribution patterns of invasive lodgepole pines and their fungal mutualists. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ian Dickie, a noted expert in invasion ecology, at Lincoln University and its partner the Bio-Protection Research Center, which have been influential in the research and implementation of New Zealand?s invasion management programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The absence of compatible mycorrhizae is thought to be a substantial barrier to invasion for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), an obligately ectomycorrhizal (ECM) invasive in much of the southern hemisphere. The dispersal and distribution patterns of lodgepole pine-associated ECM communities are likely important in determining the potential range of this invader, and may be predicted by Island Biogeography Theory. The research objectives are to (1) compare ECM communities associated with lodgepole pine in the western North America native and New Zealand invaded ranges; (2) determine whether Island Biogeography Theory can describe ECM dispersal and distribution patterns; (3) determine the spatiotemporal and environmental gradients structuring these ECM communities; and (4) predict the consequences for future plant invasions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

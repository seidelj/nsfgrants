    <AbstractNarration>This award supports student travel to The Sixth Annual ACM Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH 2015). The conference is being held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania during October 25-30, 2015. SPLASH includes OOPSLA, one of the flagship ACM SIGPLAN conferences, as well as many co-located events: Onward!, Wavefront, the Dynamic Languages Symposium, SPLASH-E (Education), the International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts &amp; Experiences, the Dynamic Languages Symposium, Pattern Languages of Programs, SPLASH-E (Education), the International Conference&amp;#8232;on Software Language Engineering, Domain Specific Modeling, and Database Programming Languages. SPLASH also includes a program of tutorials, posters, demonstrations, a Doctoral Symposium, and an ACM SIGPLAN Student Research Competition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The funding provided enables broader student participation, particularly women and underrepresented minorities, and those without adequate support at their home institution. In this way the award helps build a diverse pool of the next generation of programming language and software engineering researchers.</AbstractNarration>

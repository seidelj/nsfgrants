    <AbstractNarration>This proposed workshop seeks to enhance ethical cultures by changing how research integrity is perceived as both a research and educational area. By focusing on positive research integrity the workshop will contribute to research that will equip scientists and engineers with knowledge, skills, and a positive viewpoint to encourage them to make ethical choices and exhibit model behaviors that will benefit their communities and the broader society. The outcomes of research on positive research integrity will be of interest to administrators, educators of STEM from K-20, scientists and engineers. It will facilitate educating undergraduates and post graduates in critical thinking skills, recognizing ethical issues, navigating difficult situations, and cultivating interpersonal and communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshop aims to convene a 2 day workshop to develop a research agenda for positive research integrity in the spring of 2017. It will assemble researchers and practitioners of positive ethics, research integrity, philosophy, moral psychology, and character education. By bringing together scholars not typically in one room, recommendations and best practices will be shared as a means for articulating a research agenda. The following research questions will be tackled. (1) What are best practices in positive ethics research and education? (2) How can proven approaches in positive ethics be applied to STEM fields and workplaces? (3) What are a research agenda and research questions for Positive Research Integrity? A workshop summary and white paper will be produced and disseminated.</AbstractNarration>

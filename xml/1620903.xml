<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funds to partially support the 19th annual Conference Experience for Undergraduates (CEU), which is held as part of the Fall Meeting of the APS Division of Nuclear Physics. This year's meeting will be held October 12 - 15, 2016, in Vancouver, BC. The CEU is a natural venue for students who have had an undergraduate research experience to present the results of their work and interact with other students as well as faculty and senior researchers. The CEU has been immensely successful in fostering this interaction, which helps students to have a broad introduction and exposure to research across nuclear physics, and to enable senior researchers to get to know some of the junior future leaders. Partial support will be provided for approximately 32 undergraduate students, out of a planned total of 150.</AbstractNarration>

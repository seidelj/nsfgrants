    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Description:&lt;br/&gt;Given the ever-increasing pace of innovation in the 21st century, a workshop to identify emerging areas in ceramic and glass science is warranted. A two-and-a-half-day forum brings together 45 researchers in glass and ceramic materials to share both expertise and vision to define outstanding materials challenges. In preparation for the meeting, participants suggest and evaluate discussion topics on-line to outline the meeting agenda. In order to ensure that the workshop report has the most comprehensive influence in and beyond the ceramics community, the Journal of the American Ceramic Society, one of the top ceramic science journals, has agreed to publish the workshop report, as an open access publication. The workshop will be held in the D.C. area from Sept. 12-14, 2016. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Details:&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop on Emerging Opportunities in Ceramic and Glass Science focuses on the most recent research ideas in four material classes: amorphous materials, oxides, non-oxides, and composites. Based upon presentations and discussion by 45 materials professionals, critical research challenges are defined. The role of computational techniques for material design and property prediction is highlighted. In addition, strategies of data mining are explored as a tool for identifying new areas of study and opportunities for crosscutting research. Participants for the workshop are selected from academia, industry and national laboratories to provide the broadest possible input for identifying emerging opportunities in ceramic and glass science. These include underrepresented groups and a balance of participants over all career stages. Among the 45 are researchers from outside the materials discipline included to highlight crosscutting opportunities. The workshop report, slated for publication in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society, provides the Ceramics Program and related programs within the NSF's Division of Materials Research with a compendium of needs, opportunities and activities in ceramic and glass science.</AbstractNarration>

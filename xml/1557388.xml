    <AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, Hofstra University will partner with Nassau Community College (NCC) and four high-need school districts on Long Island, for this Scholarships &amp; Stipends Phase II project, Noyce Scholars Program Phase II: Expanding the Model. The project will support 22 juniors/seniors/post-baccalaureate students who are majoring in mathematics or a science discipline (or who have completed such a major) and who are preparing to teach secondary mathematics or science in a high-need district. Each Scholar will receive 1 or 2 years of scholarship support. The new teachers will use vetted methods of mathematics and science instruction, connecting concepts across disciplines and engaging learners in collaborative problem solving related to real world contexts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the Phase I project, this project will offer an enhanced preparation and development program with seven components specifically developed and refined based on Phase I project evaluation. Project activities include: (a) an enhanced new recruitment program; (b) STEM internships for freshman and sophomore students; (c) immersive early teaching experiences: (d) coaching of cooperating teachers in high-need school districts; (e) regular colloquia, conferences, and institutes; (f) leadership roles for Phase I alumni; and (g) an induction initiative for new teachers. The project will use quantitative and qualitative data to address research questions such as: (1) What are the longitudinal outcomes of Phase 1 Scholars, including their commitment to STEM teaching; service commitment years; perceptions of their preparedness to teach in high-need schools, retainment/support activities; and quality of teaching STEM in high-need schools? (2) To what extent does the integration of cooperating teachers into teacher preparation activities contribute to the preparedness and retention of Scholars?</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>PI: Phillip R. Westmoreland&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1512401&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The transportation of woody biomass to a central processing facility for conversion into useful liquid fuels can be costly, particularly in sparsely populated rural areas. Torrefaction is process that reduces the weight and volume of plant biomass to a form which can be transported more easily. In torrefaction, harvested biomass is heated in the absence of air at 200 to 300 degrees Celsius to create a dense bio-oil rich feedstock. However, this material is not very well characterized and contains a wide variety of compounds in gas, liquid, and solid forms. This project will develop a comprehensive mathematical model for the torrefaction of biomass that will predict the energy requirements and final product mixture, using knowledge of the detailed reaction processes. This model will then be used to develop torrefaction processes that can be tailored to make an energy-dense, low-oxygen material from woody biomass. Research results will be used to provide examples in engineering classes at undergraduate and graduate levels, and to enable the development of classroom materials on biofuel topics for high school students through the involvement of high school teachers in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive model for the elementary reactions and kinetics during the torrefaction of the hemicellulose fraction of woody biomass. In torrefaction, the biomass is heated in an inert atmosphere at 200 to 300 degrees C. It is hypothesized that pericyclic reactions, which are known to describe cellulose pyrolysis accurately, also describe the torrefaction of hemicellulose. The model will be developed using reaction kinetics experiments, computational quantum chemistry, and reaction theory. Thermogravimetric analyses will provide instantaneous heats of pyrolysis. Product gases and vapors will be profiled in real time by two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS). These experiments will be carried out with solid samples of woody biomass (loblolly pine), the hemicellulose biopolymers xylan and galactoglucomannan, and hemicellulose monomers xylose, arabinose, mannose, and galactose. The reaction processes for the flash pyrolysis of the torrefied solids will be studied by online GCxGC-TOFMS analysis of the bio-oil product vapors, complimented by analysis of the residual solid structures using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Quantum-chemistry analyses of monomer torrefaction will be expected to yield additional mechanistic insights. The full model will predict reaction kinetics and products of the torrefaction of cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of woody biomass. Educational activities based on the research include mentoring of an undergraduate process design team on the design of a thermochemical biomass processing plant, development of course materials for reaction kinetics and transport courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and research experiences for undergraduates and high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>

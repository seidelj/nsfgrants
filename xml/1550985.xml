    <AbstractNarration>Due to the ubiquity of computers and their critical role in society, modern computer engineering and science curricula incorporate a far wider range of topics than was traditionally taught. As a result, some fundamental concepts may not be sufficiently reinforced across the curriculum to allow students to understand them with full clarity. This deficiency in the Computer Engineering curriculum, a field with significant technological, scientific and societal ties, could have long-term negative impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will organize a workshop to convene faculty and experts in the discipline of Computer Engineering to address ways to improve instruction across the curriculum that (1) ensures that key ideas are sufficiently reinforced and (2) current curricular coverage is maintained. It will emphasize parallel and distributed computing, a key component of modern computer engineering and science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct impacts of this project are on expected improvements in student retention and graduation rates, and overall career success. The systematic and planned exposure of students to advanced computing concepts across the curriculum will better prepare engineers to work on complex systems. More broadly, this project will promote science by helping produce engineers well-grounded in the fundamentals who will become the next generation of scientists, researchers and faculty members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to improve education in parallel and distributed computing (PDC) by introducing key "concept dots" early on in the curriculum that can be "connected" in subsequent advanced courses. This approach is useful for a sustained reinforcement of fundamental ideas through the curriculum. More specifically, this project seeks to introduce PDC concepts through a first course in digital logic. A workshop to bring together instructors and experts in PDC and digital logic will be organized. The goals of this workshop are twofold: &lt;br/&gt; (a) Concept Inventory: Learning different approaches to and experiences from teaching core courses in computer engineering and science (including digital logic), identifying important and difficult topics and developing a set of best practices (for which topics to emphasize and how; &lt;br/&gt; (b) Concept Application: Encouraging attendees to incorporate some of the ideas from the workshop into their courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>

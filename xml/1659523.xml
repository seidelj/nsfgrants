<AbstractNarration>Professors David Paul, Julie Stenken and colleagues at the University of Arkansas host REU Site: University of Arkansas: Chemistry for Energy and Materials. This award is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. This program motivates a diverse group of students to pursue careers in scientific research. The ten participants are integrated into different research groups. Cohort activities promote student independence and the development of professional skills and judgment during the ten week summer program. Each participant is given the opportunity to present his/her research at a meeting within the department, and to write up a summary of their work in a journal format that is compiled for distribution to their home institution. Opportunities for participants to present results at national meetings are also included. The participants are provided an experience that not only enables them to obtain a realistic view of modern chemical research, but also exposes them to an environment indicative of what they can expect in graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program helps to prepare young scientists for global competition in science and innovation with a strong emphasis on the up and coming areas of chemical applications to the areas of energy and materials research. Sophomore or junior undergraduate students majoring in chemistry or biochemistry are targeted for recruitment. Special efforts are made to recruit women and minority groups traditionally underrepresented among professional chemists. A unique feature of this program is the partnership with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to recruit disabled students. The University of Arkansas Fayetteville, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has established procedures that help assure success in the recruitment of students from these groups. This aspect of the recruitment plan utilizes the University's infrastructure in minority recruiting.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The outcomes of higher education are a consequence of individuals' personality traits and many&lt;br/&gt;dimensions of the university experience. The Caltech Cohort Study (CCS) will track the entire&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student body of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) over several years. It&lt;br/&gt;uses repeated, incentivized surveys to elicit behavioral proxies: risk aversion, strategic sophistication,&lt;br/&gt;competitiveness, social behavior, etc. The results will be married with objective outcomes: academic,&lt;br/&gt;social, and financial. The project will examine the evolution of attributes over college years, the&lt;br/&gt;formation of social interactions, and ultimately how certain attributes interact to produce educational&lt;br/&gt;outcomes. The CCS also serves as an ideal environment for answering fundamental questions about&lt;br/&gt;the external validity of incentivized surveys and laboratory experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CCS has four unique features. First, Caltech's small size makes it possible to track nearly&lt;br/&gt;the entire student body over time (90% of students completed the first three surveys). Second, the&lt;br/&gt;survey design allows measurement of a large set of behavioral traits for each individual. Third,&lt;br/&gt;the repeated nature of the study makes it possible to track the stability of these traits across time&lt;br/&gt;with minimal selection bias. Fourth, the array of behavioral traits elicited can be tied to real-world&lt;br/&gt;behaviors and outcomes. The combination of these elements should be invaluable for a large battery&lt;br/&gt;of basic social science questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study has the potential to improve the educational process in US higher education.&lt;br/&gt;Understanding what impacts social and scholastic outcomes will help design certain aspects of college&lt;br/&gt;education aimed at increasing well-being and academic performance, as well as furthering gender and&lt;br/&gt;racial equality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal focuses on three areas. First, the dataset's longitudinal nature will allow for a careful&lt;br/&gt;inspection of the stability (or lack thereof) of a wide array of behavioral attributes. Second, the rich&lt;br/&gt;data on different layers of interactions over time (social, academic, and geographic) combined with&lt;br/&gt;the comprehensive set of elicited attributes will allow us to study network formation processes. Last,&lt;br/&gt;the data can be cross-checked against Caltech's experimental laboratory data to examine the impacts&lt;br/&gt;of selection into experiments as well as the differences in responses occurring in the lab and outside.&lt;br/&gt;The survey will also allow for a comparison of responses across other platforms and populations.&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the detailed longitudinal data that will be collected have the potential to uncover&lt;br/&gt;predictors of academic outcomes (chosen major, grades, and graduation), and the channels affecting&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of different traits.</AbstractNarration>

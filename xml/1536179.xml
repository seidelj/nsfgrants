    <AbstractNarration>Inorganic scintillators are widely used in modern medical imaging modalities (as converter for the x-rays and Ã£-radiation that are used to obtain information about the interior of the body, like x-ray, CT and PET scan), national security, airport security, and high energy particle detector. One key problem in the development of the next generation scintillator systems is the enhancement of the timing, positioning and energy resolution of the detectors. Most of the high-density scintillators have a high refractive index; only less than 10% of the light from the scintillator can enter into the photo detector. This seriously impacts the detection system's efficiency and detection sensitivity. This team has developed a novel class of nano-scale photonic structures that function as efficient light extraction devices for scintillator materials and devices. This is an emerging field and the proposed research has made the overall efficiency of these scintillator materials increase significantly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique properties of the nature-inspired nano-scale photonic structures allow one to engineer the output light beam shape, so that the angular behavior of the light can be controlled. This makes smaller pixel, higher imaging resolution possible for the next generation of integrated scintillator devices, with a variety of application possible in market areas including national security and medical imaging. This I-Corps team will work together to seek out market opportunities for commercialization of the innovation, discovering new and previously uncharted applications based on conversations with many potential customers throughout the United States.</AbstractNarration>

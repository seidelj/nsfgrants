    <AbstractNarration>Siena College is a vibrant undergraduate liberal arts college with a strong School of Science. Siena faculty in the sciences conduct cutting-edge research and involve undergraduate students in that research. Students also conduct independent research with faculty supervision as part of the Center for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity (CURCA) program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year project creates a state-of-the-art research oriented network infrastructure to support STEM research at the College. Research projects in the fields of computational chemistry (using Siena's High Performance Computing Cluster or HPCC), nanoscience, biophysics, astrophysics, and particle physics have been hampered by currently limited network transfer speeds. This project significantly enhances the ability for faculty and students to carry out their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project creates a network infrastructure designed to optimize networking and security for high performance scientific applications. This includes improving data transfer speeds within the School of Science building complex and between the sciences and the College data center where the HPCC is housed by a factor of 10. The proposed upgrades also position Siena to create connections to external high-performance networks such as NYSERnet and Internet2, facilitating collaboration with researchers at other institutions as well as access to instrumentation and research tools at other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of this project interdisciplinary research projects are fostered and encouraged. Sophisticated cyberinfrastructure is a critical underpinning to scientific research initiatives and this project creates that foundation at Siena College.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing an interdisciplinary technology pathway program (TPP) in data technology and applications for behavioral, social, and health science students at two California State Universities. It consists of four technical courses covering Python programming, data structures and algorithms, data technology, and an interdisciplinary senior project (or database). It will be offered as a minor degree program as part of bachelor's degree programs, or as a certificate program. The TPP program will use evidence-based teaching practices that encompass effective pedagogy as well as learning communities and faculty professional development. The program will use contextualized problem-based pedagogy in which students acquire key technical knowledge and skills by solving real-world problems. Each cohort of participating students will be formed into a learning community that will include professors and industry professionals in Silicon Valley for student support and role-modeling. The engineering and computing faculty who will teach the students in this program will engage in professional development in order to learn pedagogical approaches that have been shown effective for the diverse students in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. These faculty have agreed to participate in a Faculty Learning Community throughout the academic year and a summer Technology Pathway Summer Institute. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to generate research contributions towards the development of a technical education program for a diverse group of students and the creation of a sustainable interdisciplinary program that crosses internal organizational boundaries and links to external sponsors. If this project succeeds, it will very likely spur other campuses to develop similar programs through faculty development and dissemination plans. The ongoing evaluation of the propagation process and its outcomes will reveal valuable lessons for launching such interdisciplinary initiatives. One of the participating institutions is a minority serving institution.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of graduate students in the Summer Research Conference in Statistics and Biostatistics, held in Carolina Beach, North Carolina on June 7-10, 2015. The meeting is the 51st in a series of annual conferences sponsored by the Southern Regional Council on Statistics (SRCOS). Its purpose is to encourage the exchange of current research ideas in statistics and biostatistics and to give motivation and direction to further research progress. The conference series focuses on young researchers, providing excellent opportunities for interaction among junior researchers and leaders in the field. The meeting features talks on current research topics together with dedicated time for clarification, amplification, and further informal discussions in small groups. Under the travel support provided by this award, students will attend and present their research in posters to be reviewed by more experienced researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southern Regional Council on Statistics is a consortium of statistics and biostatistics programs in the South, stretching as far west as Texas and as far north as Maryland. It currently has member programs at 45 universities in 15 states in the region. The 2015 Summer Research Conference in Statistics and Biostatistics sponsored by SRCOS is particularly valuable for students and faculty from smaller regional schools within driving distance, affording them the opportunity to participate and interact closely with internationally-known leaders in the field without the cost of travel to distant national or international venues. It will strengthen the research of the statistics and biostatistics community as a whole, and particularly in the relatively underdeveloped southern region.

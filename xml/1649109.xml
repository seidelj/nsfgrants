    <AbstractNarration>The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is a key region of scientific interest in ice-ocean interaction, global connections and influences on the climate system, and polar climate change. In addition, the region is one of the largest potential contributors to sea-level rise in the coming centuries. The overall goal of this workshop is to foster multi-disciplinary discussion and planning among a broad array of scientists from different backgrounds and career stages. The priorities for discussion and further development are guided by a 2015 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific goals for this 23rd WAIS workshop are to (1) air the latest WAIS science, (2) discuss potential next steps in community planning to respond to the top priority in the 2015 NAS report, (3) engage students and early career scientists, (4) discuss new technologies, modeling approaches, and potential field targets for future research, and (5) encourage research data submission and good metadata practices. The workshop will be held on 3-6 October, 2016 near Washington, DC.</AbstractNarration>

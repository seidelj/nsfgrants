    <AbstractNarration>1551342&lt;br/&gt;Moecher&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal submitted to the EAR Instrumentation and Facilities Program, the PIs requested $149,947 to support acquisition of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for grain-scale textural and chemical characterization of earth materials by faculty and students in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Kentucky (UK). The requested SEM would support NSF/EAR funded research in petrotectonics and other fields. Specific studies would include investigations of mid-crustal transpression that require dating of deformed plutonic rocks via zircon U-Pb geochronology and dating monazite growth tied to deformation microstructures in metapelites within and bounding zones of transpression. Prior to U-Pb and monazite geochronologic techniques SEM imaging of zircons and monazites via SEM is required. Additional research includes studies of the petrogenesis of granites and sedimentary rocks, the latter with implications for hydrocarbon reservoir evaluation and for studies of the effects of CO2 injection on reservoir rock mineralogy and porosity evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested SEM would support graduate and undergraduate student research training and local high school outreach efforts by the PI and benefit scientists at the on-campus branch of the Kentucky Geological Survey, where the instrument would be housed. This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national welfare given the importance of student training opportunities in microanalysis technologies to support future scientific workforce needs and the advancement of research that may benefit future subsurface carbon dioxide sequestration efforts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

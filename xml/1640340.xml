<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR technology translation project will facilitate the development and commercialization of graphene and graphene-silicon composite anodes in next-generation Lithium-ion batteries, with significantly higher energy density as compared to their present-day counterparts. The proposed technology is important because Lithium-ion batteries need significant improvement to keep pace with the needs of customers who are demanding high specific energy, long service life, high power on demand and quick charging. If scalable, the proposed graphene technology could help satisfy these requirements and could find widespread use in various applications such as wearables (smart watches and google glass), portable electronics (cell phones, laptops), unmanned aerial vehicles as well as electric vehicles and grid storage. This project will result in a scaled-up demonstration of a minimally viable product (MVP). Based on preliminary testing, this MVP is expected to deliver volumetric and gravimetric energy densities of up to ~1000 Watt-hour/liter and ~650 Watt-hour/kilogram respectively. These performance metrics are 2-3 fold superior to the incumbent graphite anode technology which is extensively used in today's Lithium-ion batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: (1) Methods to achieve scalable (roll-to-roll) manufacturing of graphene electrodes for Lithium batteries and (2) Assembly of the electrodes into larger format pouch/cylindrical cells that can deliver the voltage and capacity-ratings of various end-use applications. To address manufacturing, the team will develop novel aqueous electrode slurries that can be deposited in a scalable manner using state-of-art doctor blade and slot-die coating methods. The deliverable for this project will be a minimally viable product (pouch and cylindrical cell batteries) that can be subjected to third-party validation and also field-tested by potential customers. This will facilitate joint development agreements with customers and private investors to begin production at industrially relevant scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students (1 graduate and 2 undergraduates) involved in the project will develop important skill-sets including scalable electrode manufacturing, pouch/cylindrical cell assembly and system level testing of the prototypes. In a pure laboratory environment, such studies are often excluded, thereby preventing the students from experiencing the stringent standards and rigors of the industry. Additionally, the students will actively participate in conferences and other networking events where they will have extensive networking opportunities and the potential to meet like-minded entrepreneurial students and industry experts.</AbstractNarration>

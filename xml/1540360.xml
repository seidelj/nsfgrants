    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to understand the nutritional drivers of Bornean orangutan foraging behavior. The project will be the first to test the assumption that orangutans maximize calories as part of their foraging strategy and will examine the nutrient priorities and balancing of orangutans to determine if protein is held at a constant level. Orangutan foraging may be a good model for the evolution of human dietary adaptations, because orangutans are large-bodied apes foraging in unpredictable habitats outside of the African rainforest, similar to early human ancestors. Understanding orangutan nutrient needs is also critical to the conservation of this endangered species. This project will be one of the first describing the importance of non-fruit orangutan foods, which are critical to conservation efforts. The research and findings are being shared with the Indonesian Parks Department to develop conservation strategies. Additionally, the project also will support international research collaborations and capacity building, and training of US students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted in Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, a field site that is unique in offering a mosaic of habitat types in which 2,500 wild orangutans range. Non-invasive full-day focal animal follows will yield a complete characterization of orangutan diet, with samples of every consumed food collected and analyzed for nutrient content. Using new statistical analysis techniques it is possible to test linear (optimal foraging, maximization or minimization theories) and geometric (nutrient balancing theories) models of orangutan foraging, and to determine if these strategies can co-exist. Improvements in GIS technologies, and the introduction of the Movement Ecology paradigm will allow an assessment of the goals of orangutan foraging and whether orangutans utilize landmark based navigation and certain movement patterns seen in humans.</AbstractNarration>

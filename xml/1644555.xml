    <AbstractNarration>This I-Corps L project from Northwestern University (NU) will focus on scaling and sustaining of an educational innovation, nScope, one of the centerpieces in the parent NSF project funded under the "Engaged Student Learning" track in the IUSE: EHR program. The nScope system is a USB-powered device that plugs into an electronics prototyping breadboard. The nScope is equipped with an oscilloscope, power supply, two function generators and two pulse generators. The hardware is accompanied by a graphical interface and an open application program interface (API) for custom control from any platform - PC, Mac, and Raspberry Pi. The current version is easy and safe for beginners, yet powerful enough for experts. The versatility makes nScope a potent educational tool for all types of STEM learners. This I-Corps for Learning project will investigate ways to increase the impact of this innovative project so that more STEM students can benefit from the capabilities of nScope. Possible paths to be explored include partnerships and collaborations with universities, community colleges, and engineering licensure boards. Tutorials or modules will be tailored to the user needs. The scaling of the innovation will investigate means of sustaining the project including potential commercial outlets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research has established that the learner-centered, knowledge-centered, assessment-centered, and community-centered aspects of a course enhance student learning. Aspects of hardware improvement, tutorial development, learning module customization, and the way that the users interact with the products play roles in whether the education innovation embodies principles of effective learning. Broader adoption outside the classroom where end users are much more diverse provides an opportunity to consider more demographic factors in assessing the education innovation and in designing materials that take those factors into account. The customizable features and low cost of nScope have the potential to make some types of STEM instruction more interactive and effective for a variety of students. The project will help advance knowledge regarding how to support successful adaptation of experiential modules across different curricula, multiple engineering disciplines, and a range of institutional cultures.</AbstractNarration>

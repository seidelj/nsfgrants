    <AbstractNarration>Although the diversity of traits observed in nature can seem infinite, it still represents only a subset of possible traits. Furthermore, some traits have evolved repeatedly in distantly related species. Does repeated origin of certain traits reflect shared genetic constraints? The structure of gene networks that control development could favor the evolution of some traits while making the origin of other traits less likely. In order to determine the role of gene networks in shaping biological diversity, this study will identify and compare the molecular mechanisms that led to the independent origin of similar traits in two distantly related species. This research provides important insights into the translation of genotype to phenotype. The PIs propose novel mentoring in molecular techniques to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed study investigates distantly related groups of fruit fly species, which have independently gained similar male-specific morphological structures. Previous work has shown that the gene doublesex (dsx) is important in the formation of these traits in both groups, and that specific changes in the DNA sequence of dsx correlate with the origin of one of these structures. This research will test whether evolutionary changes in the same or different DNA sequences are associated with the origin of the convergent structure in the other group. Answering this question will help determine the role of the genetic network encompassing dsx in the independent origin of similar traits in these two groups of species.</AbstractNarration>

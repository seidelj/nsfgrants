    <AbstractNarration>Recent decades have seen increasing attention to and progress in research in undergraduate mathematics education (RUME). Relative to K-12 mathematics education research, which is more than a century old as a field, RUME is a young area, beginning to become visible only a few decades ago. During these decades, the need to understand the learning and teaching of undergraduate mathematics, and the related need to develop scholars to conduct the research, has become more pressing. In this project, investigators from the University of Oklahoma and the University of Northern Colorado will catalyze a network of RUME scholars through a conference that emphasizes the generation and strengthening of new collaborations and the central participation of novices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation of experts and leaders in RUME will come from the current generation of graduate students, early-career RUME faculty, and mathematicians seeking to gain experience and expertise in this field. The conference will specifically, and with active intention, engage these participants to strengthen their expertise and build collaborations. Themes will include research in student learning, research in pre/business/STEM calculus, research in problem-solving/proving, research in equity in mathematics education, and research in statistics education and quantitative literacy. The conference will produce a list of priority open research questions in RUME as well as a network of expert and novice researchers collaborating to advance the field.</AbstractNarration>

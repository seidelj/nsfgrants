    <AbstractNarration>The project focuses on commercialization of new techniques that improve communication performance of battery-less, passive radio frequency identification (RFID)-based systems. Such passive communication is already used in many industries and application due to its benefits of small size, wireless communication capabilities, wireless powering of the device, lack of battery and related maintenance, easy deployment, environment friendly (no battery pollution), etc. However, this good characteristic comes with a drawback: short range and interference when a large number of devices is deployed in a small area. This prevented employment of RFID in applications where large number of tags is to be read and also produces hesitations in future usage of RFID systems in Internet of Things (IoT). Yet there is large market potential. The current (in 2015), passive RFID market is over $8 billion worldwide ranging from retail industry and tracking object to health care and Internet of Things (IoT). Specifically, UHF RFID field is expecting to have over $ 9.5 billion market by 2018. This market craves for increasing read rates, extending range, material compatible tags and security. The proposed solution will remedy a low read rate problem and security concerns in RFID market while extending the communication range and providing more power for advanced, smart applications. The proposed technique can be used for UHF RFID tags to increase read rates in warehouses (e.g., Walmart) and extend the range in wireless sensor networks (e.g., NASA). Considering the individual specification of these products it is expected that RFID manufactures and consumers will welcome the introduction of these products to the market. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work includes discovery of potential customers and their needs with respect to RFID technology. In contrast to existing work that often focuses on purely technical advancements, the proposed effort aims at refining the proposed solution for improving the performance RFID such that the customers needs are addressed. The proposed solutions aim at combining four novel approaches to developing a more efficient RFID tag including:&lt;br/&gt; (1) novel RFID tag antenna design that maximizes backscatter signal by 200% over existing designs; &lt;br/&gt; (2) flexible impedance matching network for loading the RFID tag antenna that allows dynamic tuning of antenna properties to compensate for mutual coupling and interference from environment; &lt;br/&gt; (3) collaborative scheme where adjacent RFID tags improve communication performance by using both the antenna and impedance tuning circuitry to minimize their destructive interference and coupling; and &lt;br/&gt; (4) introducing a new operation state for RFID tags in a network fashion in that tags can receive signal from the environment but they produce minimum scattering (interference) to the environment. The customer discovery will ensure that the resulting solution will be commercially viable. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, the team will develop a prototype and proof-of-concept demonstration that will target the customer needs and show the value proposition.</AbstractNarration>

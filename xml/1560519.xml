    <AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program in the NSF Division of Chemistry supports Professor Jentoft of the University of Oklahoma in Norman in investigating heterogeneously catalyzed aldol condensation reactions for biomass conversion. This endeavor will be undertaken in collaboration with Karen Wilson at the Cardiff Catalysis Institute in Wales in the UK, whose research will be supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of the UK (EPSRC). Aldol condensation is a key chemical transformation for the conversion of small oxygenates from biomass to fungible fuels because it increases carbon chain length and reduces oxygen content. The PIs will synthesize families of novel materials that differ in acid-base properties, surface hydrophobicity, and morphology. The catalytic performance in aldol condensations using diagnostic and bio-oil-representative reactants will be tested. The acquired knowledge will allow the development of improved solid aldol condensation catalysts that are highly selective and stable in aggressive media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigated chemical transformation, aldol condensation, is a key step in the production of second generation bio-fuels and plays a role in several commercial chemical processes. The proposed research will provide the fundamental insight that is necessary to develop novel materials that catalyze this transformation with great efficiency, that is, without excessive energy input or generation of chemical waste. The program will also provide cross-disciplinary scientific and technical training and an international exchange experience for the involved researchers. US students will have the opportunity to perform research and participate in educational activities within the Cardiff Catalysis Institute, a center of excellence in the UK established at Cardiff University.</AbstractNarration>

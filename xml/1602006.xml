<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the discovery of novel microcantilever heaters to fill the need for highly sensitive and selective volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors with an ultra-low power requirement.   These VOC sensors are important because of their strong impact on environmental protection and indoor air quality monitoring which has direct influence on human health and well-being.  The project will result in the development of a commercially viable prototype of a novel VOC sensor packaged in the form of a miniaturized handheld device. This VOC sensor has unique features of high sensitivity and selective detection of VOCs individually and in mixtures, and operation at low heater temperature without catalyst coating.   These features provide the advantages of faster and unique detection of VOCs in a complex environment, much lower power consumption, and higher reliability and operational lifetime, when compared to the leading competing pellistor and photo-ionization based sensors currently available in this market space.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The VOC sensor to be developed will address: (i) the inability of the current technologies to perform selective detection of analytes, (ii) higher operational power requirement due to high heater temperature, and low operational lifetime due to usage of a laser or catalyst coating. A combination of unique features of the proposed VOC sensor, including low heater temperature, lack of catalyst coating, and selective VOC detection utilizing their physical properties, enables it to address the aforementioned limitations of the current technology. In addition, the personnel involved in this project, at both graduate and undergraduate levels, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through participation in the project activities directly related to commercialization and mentorship from the industrial partner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Tangidyne Inc. to guide the commercialization aspects of the sensor developed, and provide unique business mentorship to the graduate and undergraduate students involved in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>

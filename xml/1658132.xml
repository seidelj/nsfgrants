    <AbstractNarration>During the strong La Niña event in 2010-2011, extreme ocean warming and a marine heat wave off the west coast of Australia were observed. This extreme warming event is termed as "Ningaloo Niño", an analogy to other eastern continental boundary warming phenomena such as El Niño in the Pacific and the Benguela Niño in the Atlantic. During the recent Ningaloo Niño event, SSTs off the west coast of Australia were more than 5 degree centigrade above long-term seasonal means, which is sufficient to impact large-scale atmospheric circulation and has devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and resources. In this region, locally and remotely forced ocean circulations in the southeast Indian Ocean, such as Leeuwin current system, may play a crucial role in the development of the Ningaloo Niño event. The primary goal of this proposed project is to understand physical processes that control the development of Ningaloo Niño/Niña. The proposed project will contribute to the plan and design of major international field campaigns and improving observational network in the Indian Ocean, enhancing education through supporting students and a post-doc, and advancing climate prediction. One of the PIs' institutions is recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education, and thus the project will contribute to providing training opportunities for underrepresented minorities. In addition, the proposed research will identify key processes that must be represented well in climate models, which will help improve climate model simulation and benefit society by providing more reliable climate prediction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A variety of oceanic processes that affect the 'Ningaloo Niño' will be explored in the proposed study including: 1) The impact of the remote forcing from the Pacific Ocean versus forcing over the Indian Ocean on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Niño/Niña; 2) Effects of topographic trapping of westward radiating Rossby waves and their associated downwelling/upwelling associated with Ningaloo Niño/Niña events; 3) The influence of the MJO on Leeuwin current and Ningaloo Niño/Niña via oceanic processes; 4) The role of Australian summer monsoon in affecting the Ningaloo Niño/Niña events. A high-resolution Indo-Pacific basin ocean general circulation model (OGCM) will be employed, which can adequately represent complex bathymetry and topography in the Indonesian Seas. The data from enhanced in-situ observations and satellite data will be thoroughly analyzed and maximally utilized to validate the model. A series of process-oriented OGCM experiments will be performed, to quantify the impacts of remote &amp; local forcing on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo/Niño, and identify key processes involved, including the role of coastal Kelvin waves and radiation of Rossby waves. The results will identify the physical processes that determine the sea surface temperature and upper-ocean variability associated with Ningaloo Niño, which can alter atmospheric circulations. In particular, the impacts of Madden-Julian oscillation and the remote forcing from the Pacific on the Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Niño, which cannot be isolated by observations alone, will be quantified by a series of OGCM experiments. Consequently, completion of the proposed project will substantially advance our understanding of the dynamics of Leeuwin current system and Ningaloo Niño that is major climate variability in the southeast Indian Ocean.</AbstractNarration>

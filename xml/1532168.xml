    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professors Brian Bennett and colleague Richard Holz from Marquette University will upgrade of an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This upgrade will provide a high-quality cryogenic EPR system for research and education, without the expense of a new instrument. This equipment will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species with unpaired electrons behave. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Marquette. Additionally, the investigators have identified a significant number of interested users from the area outside of this institution. Examples are major users from the Universities of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, Madison and Parkside as well as St Maurice College, Milwaukee School of Engineering and Concordia University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) carrying out mechanistic studies on nitrile hydratase; (b) studying structural and functional models for metalloenzyme active centers; (c) studying inorganic supramolecular and materials chemistry; (d) studying nitrogen-cycle enzymes; (e) assembling and regulating of Cyt c oxidase by Hig1 and oxa1p; and (f) investigating carbenes, carbocations and non-covalent halogen interactions.</AbstractNarration>

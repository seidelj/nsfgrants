    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to provide a better understanding of what neural processes make up extracellular potentials recorded from brain, like the electroencephalogram (EEG). Although recorded in many settings, these potentials are poorly understood. Yet, they are clinically important; for instance, they are used for diagnosis of epilepsy and early detection of deafness. Development of differential diagnostic tools depends on understanding what brain components contribute to the recorded potentials. The investigators use a combination of quantitative modeling and recordings from the auditory system of the Barn Owl to gain insight into the connection between field potentials and their neuronal generators. In addition to better understanding of a widely used diagnostic tool, a further societally relevant outcome of the project lies in training women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. The U.S. and the German laboratories in this international collaboration have a strong commitment to science education and a well-established track record of training research fellows, as well as high school students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extracellular field potentials are typically generated by various neuronal sources, making their interpretation difficult. They are, however, clinically important, with applications ranging from diagnostics to brain-computer interfaces. In the auditory system, for example, the auditory evoked potential, also called the auditory brainstem response (ABR) is widely used for newborn hearing screening but little is known how specific nuclei contribute to it structure. Motivated by clinical relevance and theoretical importance of understanding extracellular field potentials, the international team applies a combined computational and neurophysiological investigation of the extracellular field potential in a bird model system. The targeted neural structure, the Nucleus Laminaris in the Barn Owl, is homogeneous and well organized, and allows direct access to a system with a large extracellular field potential. The investigators' models and experiments delineate the potential contributions of the three possible sources of the extracellular field potentials. The approach tightly integrates theory and experiments, to provide a fundamental understanding of the connection between the extracellular field potentials and their neuronal generators. The results from this collaborative cross-disciplinary effort will provide a basis for the interpretation of the clinically relevant ABR. A companion project is being funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).</AbstractNarration>

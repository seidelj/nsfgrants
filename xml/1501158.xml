    <AbstractNarration>This project will identify opportunities and strategies to support the integration of citizen science into science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. Public participation in scientific research is growing rapidly. It is resulting in important scientific insights and is engaging the public in authentic scientific experiences. However, citizen science has yet to achieve its full potential for improving STEM learning by enabling learners' full participation in the practices of science in the process of leading to scientific insight. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from across disciplines to identify citizen science projects that are also exemplary models for learning by the public. Workshop participants will generate ideas and potential solutions to overcome barriers to implementing citizen science to improve learning outcomes in schools, museums, parks, and other learning environments with diverse audiences. Consistent with the aims of the Advancing Informal Science Learning program of the Division of Research on Learning, this workshop will advance new approaches to and evidence-based understanding of the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments and pave the way to broaden access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences for underrepresented audiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-day workshop will be held in San Jose, California on February 11th and 12th, 2015, as a component of the Citizen Science 2015 Conference. It will be led by the Citizen Science Association Education Working Group. The goal of the workshop is to facilitate growth, innovation, and improved outcomes in the use of citizen science in STEM education for diverse, informal audiences. The workshop will result in (1) interdisciplinary discussions and sharing of perspectives, best practices, and innovations among leading researchers, educators, and citizen science practitioners; (2) a framework for bridging citizen science and STEM education communities and effectively implementing citizen science in a variety of learning environments; and (3) a draft research, resource development, and action agenda to advance the use of citizen science for STEM learning. The workshop will help to establish a global community of practice invested in improving STEM learning outcomes through citizen science in informal learning environments.</AbstractNarration>

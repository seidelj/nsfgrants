    <AbstractNarration>Feedbacks between Earth's climate, the global carbon cycle, and the composition of seawater constitute one of the primary mechanisms invoked for maintaining habitable conditions on our planet over much of its 4 billion year history. This project seeks to provide a new foundation for our understanding of the marine processes that play a significant but underappreciated role in moderating Earth's chemical cycles through time. The research component of this CAREER award would involve the development and application of new analytical methods and tools to investigate some of the most poorly understood ways in which the chemical balance of the oceans is maintained. CAREER awards are also designed to support particularly strong educational efforts and the integration of research and education. To this end, Higgins proposes an educational monitoring program of urban tap water in Trenton, NJ in collaboration with Isles, Inc., a community development organization. This project would be carried out by teams consisting of Isles, Inc. employees, community volunteers, Trenton students, Princeton undergraduates, the lead investigator, and a postdoctoral investigator. Students would learn the steps of the scientific method through an investigation of the chemistry of their home tap water, get exposure to the nuts-and-bolts behind how science works, and develop an appreciation for how science can empower an individual and impact a community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to investigate marine processes that affect the flow of cations, alkalinity, and CO2 through the ocean-atmosphere system with the targeted application of high-precision high-throughput measurements of stable isotope ratios of magnesium (26Mg/24Mg), calcium (44Ca/42Ca), and potassium (41K/39K) by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC ICP-MS). Specific research topics that will be pursued are 1) Global sinks of Mg and K in authigenic marine clays, 2) Global fluxes of Mg and Ca associated with diagenesis of shallow-water carbonate sediments, and 3) Global fluxes of Mg and Ca in low temperature seafloor hydrothermal systems. Approaches include laboratory experiments as well as analysis of sediment and pore-fluid samples.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together researchers who are currently promoting various types of idealized experiments and diagnostic studies to address this problem by individual scientists and groups, in order to compare their results, and formulate productive coordinated experiments that can become part of the experiment design for the decadal prediction experiments for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). In order to provide robust decadal climate predictions, the research community must improve the capabilities of decadal climate predictions. Improved understanding of the processes and mechanisms in the climate system that lead decadal climate variability is crucial. NSF funds will provide travel support of early career scientists at the workshop to be held in Aspen CO, June 7-12, 2015. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to bring together the World Climate Research Program Decadal Climate Prediction Panel to compare their results and formulate productive coordinated experiments to further the understanding regarding processes and mechanisms that could produce prediction skill on decadal timescales. Approximately 30 scientists from the DCPP, which is made up of the Working Group on Coupled Models and the Working Group on Seasonal to Interannual Prediction will participate from the United States as well as from key international modeling groups.</AbstractNarration>

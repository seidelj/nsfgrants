    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Clifford Lectures on Algebraic Groups: Structure and Actions" held March 2-5, 2015 at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. The conference will stimulate research on the interplay between geometry and number theory. An important goal of this conference is to prepare graduate students for research in the areas of algebraic group theory, algebraic geometry, and number theory, in particular to suggest thesis projects. The Clifford Lecture Series is a medium-sized conference and it provides ample opportunities for its participants to interact with each other. This atmosphere is invaluable especially for graduate students and junior researchers new to the field. It is anticipated that the meeting will lead to active collaborations between the participants, including students and faculty from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main speaker is Michel Brion (University of Grenoble, France). His talks focus on the structure and actions of algebraic groups over arbitrary fields, the applications of algebraic group theory to algebraic geometry (automorphism groups and their birational analogues) and number theory, and various aspects of homogeneous varieties and their equivariant embeddings (algebra, algebraic combinatorics, geometry).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: http://tulane.edu/sse/math/news/clifford-lectures-march-2015.cfm</AbstractNarration>

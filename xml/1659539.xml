    <AbstractNarration>It has been widely recognized that understanding and controlling the most elemental unit of light - the photon - is essential to innovating light-based technology as well as improving critical elements of our nation's defense and security. The students in this REU Site program, Nano-, Bio-, and Quantum Photonics at the University of Rochester, Institute of Optics, will participate in investigations at the frontiers of photonic research contributing to discoveries in nanoscience, bioscience and quantum science. The primary objective of the REU is an immersive experience in science and engineering at the forefront of photonics research. A diverse cohort of students from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research opportunities, will participate in interdisciplinary projects that touch on topics in the life sciences, quantum sciences and nanotechnology. Ultimately this REU program will enhance our nation's capabilities by training top-quality students to become key contributors in the commercial photonics sector, leaders on the frontiers of fundamental photonic science and engineering, and the very best educators in colleges and universities across the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over 9 summer weeks, the University of Rochester will host 12 undergraduate students who will participate in interdisciplinary research on exemplary projects such as photonic spectroscopy for bone quality monitoring and novel device fabrication for generating quantum states of light. Professional development activities will also expose the REU students to the excellent career opportunities, both academic and industry based, available in photonics. The Institute of Optics will provide a world-class research environment in photonics for the participants, let them participate in its long-running Industrial Associates program for networking and interviews, and expose them to the dynamic Photonics community through interactions with the Rochester Regional Photonics Cluster. A product of this program will be to create a well-defined pathway to a career in photonics for the REU participants' with a particular focus on underrepresented demographics, undergraduates from partner universities without strong photonics research programs, and community college students' who might not otherwise recognize such a career path is possible. It is anticipated that many of the projects will lead to original and publishable research results in the photonics sciences. In addition to the research opportunities, existing resources at the Institute of Optics - the Institute Summer School and Industrial Associates Program - will provide research specific photonics training and a mechanism for continued contact with the REU cohort. Within the greater Rochester community, the REU program will leverage both AIM Photonics and the Rochester Regional Photonics Cluster to inform the participants of all the potential career possibilities that exist in the photonics sector.</AbstractNarration>

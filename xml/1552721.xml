    <AbstractNarration>Acquiring mates is one of the most fundamental steps to successfully reproducing in many animals. Individuals vary widely in how many mates they acquire, and as a result, how many offspring they produce. Understanding why such variation exists and how it is linked to traits of he organisms is essential for understanding variation between the sexes, populations, and species. Surprisingly, scientists are often unable to predict the conditions under which strong variation in mate acquisition will exist and which traits improve mate acquisition. This research will theoretically and empirically identify a range of understudied ecological factors that influence mate acquisition, thereby transforming our understanding of how animals successfully reproduce. The principle investigator's proposed educational activities will be integrated seamlessly into the project and facilitate training of diverse K-12 students and teachers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced understanding of mate acquisition necessitates that we 1) determine the relative importance of various factors affecting mating, 2) assess how such effects are manifested in nature, and 3) merge theoretical predictions with empirical data to explore how well we understand the operation of mate acquisition. To accomplish these goals, the PI will use an integrative approach that employs empirical and theoretical tools to 1) assess the effects of resource availability, chance, life history, and more well studied factors on mating dynamics and 2) empirically explore the relationship between such factors and phenotypic traits that increase mating success in a range of fish species. Students will be involved in all aspects of the research and the PI will lead K-12 outreach activities. The project also involves collaborative research in Finland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Funding supporting the international component was provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

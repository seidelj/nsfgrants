    <AbstractNarration>The central idea in this project is to motivate students to pursue studies in STEM areas by creating and disseminating scalable modules that demonstrate in a compelling manner how math and engineering theory enables modern applications such as those embedded in wireless devices. The goal is to motivate graduates to create high-tech products, enter the high-tech workforce, and become innovators. This project will promote a transformative STEM education agenda by developing and disseminating innovative and scalable content for several courses. These innovative products will promote a positive attitude change towards learning STEM concepts by continuously fusing theory with high tech applications. Objectives include developing a diverse community of users, innovative products with mobile video-streamed content, software training modules for skill building, e-books, and training workshops. The PIs will create and disseminate products on multidisciplinary STEM applications in areas including engineering, arts and media, and earth systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovative educational modules will have comprehensive multidisciplinary content to address diverse audiences. Modules will be packaged for mobile delivery and will be multipurpose, multidisciplinary, and will: a) motivate students to learn theory through compelling applications, b) engage students in implementation for skill building and workforce creation purposes, and c) immerse diverse audiences and stakeholders in hands-on workshops for outreach, retention, and recruitment purposes. This project is based on collaboration between ASU and Clarkson University and engages faculty from Johns Hopkins University, Phoenix College, St. Lawrence University, Prairie View A&amp;M University, and Corona del Sol high school. The project will use a mixed-method assessment process (qualitative and quantitative data collection) to build an understanding of the impact of the use of the modules, apps, and other tools on student learning gains, from the individual concept level to more general knowledge about scientific and engineering habits of mind and research practice. Assessments will be done through electronic web tools, pre- and post- quizzes, presentations, one-to-one interviews, and ordinary in-class testing.</AbstractNarration>

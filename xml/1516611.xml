    <AbstractNarration>Throughout airports and hospitals around the world, x-ray imaging technologies are used for the safety and concern of mankind. For example, these technologies are employed to detect dangerous explosive and illegal drugs by homeland security. The applications are not limited only to medicine and science, but to general industry, and hence the need for cost-effective x-ray sources that are reliable and produce optimal yields is ever present. The dense plasma focus device, which is known as a device that can generate fusion reactions, has recently been established as a very efficient source of x-rays, thus making the desire to find and optimize a high performance and high repetition device tremendous. Presently, such a device has been developed and implemented at the National Institute of Education in Singapore, and work has been done to optimize the performance and enhance its reproducibility. This award funds research to conduct a comprehensive study of dense plasma focus plasmas through the use of x-ray spectroscopy and imaging. Conducting the proposed research under the supervision of Dr. Rajdeep Rawat provides the valuable opportunity of studying radiation and plasma formation from this type of device. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Access to the host?s device will allow for a detailed spectroscopic examination and imaging measurements on pinch plasmas from a dense plasma focus device, which has not yet been done. The ultimate goal of completing this research is to advance knowledge and understanding within the field of pinch plasmas. Specifically, use of spectroscopy, imaging measurements, and theoretical models will enhance the understanding of x-ray emission efficiency from such experiments. Various diagnostic tools such as silicone diodes, x-ray pinhole cameras, and a spectrometer will be used to enhance knowledge about the experimental plasma parameters. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Science Foundation of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>

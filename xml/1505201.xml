    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to the University of Michigan for the biannual Meeting of the American Physical Society (APS) Division of Particles and Fields (DPF). The objective of the Division of Particles and Fields (DPF) of the American Physical Society (APS) is the "study of fundamental particles and fields, their structure, their interactions and interrelationships, the design and development of high energy accelerators, and the design and development of instrumentation techniques for high energy physics" (from http://www.aps.org/units/dpf/. The DPF Meeting is a biannual event which brings together physicists working in all of those areas to present results and exchange ideas. NSF support will be used to facilitate the attendance of students and members of under-represented groups at the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific program will include a combination of plenary and parallel sessions in physics sub-disciplines such as Particle Accelerators, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), Computing in High Energy Physics, Charge Parity (CP) Violation, Detector Research and Development, Electroweak Physics, Higgs Sector, Field and String Theory, Neutrino Physics, Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Low Energy Searches for (BSM) Physics, Physics at Lepton Colliders, Heavy Flavor Physics, Top Quark Physics, Hadron Spectroscopy, Perturbative and non-Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Outreach, Careers, and Women and Minorities in Physics.</AbstractNarration>

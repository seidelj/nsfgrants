    <AbstractNarration>****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) is a new institution resulting from the merger of the University of Texas Pan American (UTPA) and UT Brownsville (UTB). UTRGV will open its doors in September 2015 as an emerging research institution with a new medical school. UTRGV will open with over 30,000 students being 89% Hispanic. The proposed UTRGV-UMN PREM partnership will provide opportunities to develop research and education infrastructure. This PREM will directly impact over 140 students (20 M.S. and 120 B.S.) most of whom will be first generation college students from underrepresented groups. The state of the art proposed research, combined with the PIs experience in leading successful scholarly enterprises presents an opportunity to further develop basic knowledge and technology in materials science while strengthening the STEM workforce by equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities to thrive. The PIs have a strong track record of working with UG students, and will mentor junior faculty to further improve student success through research projects. The PREM team will disseminate acquired knowledge in peer-reviewed journal articles, conference presentations, and multiple outreach activities to K-12 students and teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Technical Summary****&lt;br/&gt;The PREM team will combine efforts from seven different departments within UTRGV and three from UMN to promote fundamental understanding and development of technology. Specifically, the selected subprojects are: (1) Magnetoelectric Effects in Perovskite Complex Metal Oxides; (2) Nonflammable, Ionic Liquid-Based Electrolytes for Safer Lithium-ion Batteries; (3) Synthesis of Conjugated Polymers for Photovoltaics and Electrolyte Gated Transistors; (4) Homeostasis of Cultured Mammalian Cells in a Nanofiber Environment Development of NFs for bio-related applications; and (5) Cellular Imaging Using Persistent Luminescent Spinel Nanoparticles. These projects will: (a) aim in the development of students with strong analytical skills, creativity/innovation, teamwork, leadership, and work ethics to become visionaries and entrepreneurs in the materials science workforce; (b) promote an exchange of faculty and students between UMN/UTRGV; (c) raise STEM awareness in K-12 students while increasing awareness of innovation and creative thinking among K-12 teachers; and (d) improve UTRGV's research, academic, and community infrastructure, to promote long term growth and sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

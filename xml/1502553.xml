    <AbstractNarration>This project is a mathematics research training group in the areas of number theory, applied algebra, and algebraic geometry. The research group activities, centered on training through research involvement for students and postdoctoral associates, include collaborative undergraduate research labs (CURLs), a summer enhancement program for training new U.S. graduate students, and miniconferences and graduate student research conferences. Postdoctoral associates receive substantial mentoring to ensure their continued professional development, and graduate students play a central role in the research activity. Graduate students mentor undergraduates in CURL participation, spend semesters in the new Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, and receive special fellowships at the critical juncture of starting a thesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Algebraic Geometry, Applied Algebra, and Number Theory Group at Wisconsin has seen a recent influx of faculty with substantial experience in mentoring students. The group will develop a unique, ground-breaking program in Applied Algebra, in conjunction with the multidisciplinary Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, providing broad training in the education of students and postdocs for diverse careers in academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>1604983 - McEnally&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biofuels can potentially meet America's energy needs and they are a domestic source of energy that lessens dependence on imported oil.  They are green fuels that can reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide.  Most importantly for this project, they emit smaller amounts of most pollutants when burned, especially soot particles.  Soot emissions contribute to particulate loadings in the atmosphere that produce chronic health effects and cause millions of deaths worldwide each year.  Moreover, soot particles absorb sunlight and directly heat the atmosphere; recent evidence suggests they are the second largest contributor to global warming.  This project will generate fundamental combustion data that engineers can use to design cleaner-burning devices and that policymakers can use to select the biofuels that offer the greatest benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the combustion behavior of biofuels will be studied by adding them in small amounts to a baseline methane flame, then measuring the subsequent changes in species concentrations and particle properties.  This fuel perturbation strategy allows all of the biofuels to be studied under the same combustion conditions, such that their propensity to form soot particles and other pollutants can be directly compared.  Thus the measurements will produce a direct ranking of the emission benefits of potential biofuels.  Furthermore, the fuel perturbation strategy requires only very small samples for testing, which is critical since fuels are often only available in limited quantities during the development phase.  A good example are biodiesel fuels that will be generated from algal oils in milliliter quantities by another research group at Yale.  Particle concentrations in the flames will be measured by laser-induced incandescence and color-ratio pyrometry.  Particle size and morphology will be measured by collecting particles on thermophoretic probes and then analyzing them with electron microscopy and other surface science techniques.  Species concentrations will be measured by extracting gas samples with a microprobe and then analyzing them with on-line photoionization mass spectrometry.  The species results will provide insight into the oxidation and pollutant formation mechanisms for the biofuels, and serve as data for validating computer simulations of these mechanisms.  A general understanding of these mechanisms will help identify which of the many possible biofuels have the most attractive properties, and computer simulations will lead to design tools that can be used by practicing engineers.</AbstractNarration>

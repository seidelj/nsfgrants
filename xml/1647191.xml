    <AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This project studies the effectiveness of political strategies. In particular, it evaluates the notion that political strategies that invoke threat serve to increase political participation among the affected audience. Previous work suggests that messages invoking fear lead to a increased attention to politics, thereby increasing the likelihood of participation. In this project, the PI argues that relying on strategies focusing only on fear or threat might actually lead to lower levels of participation by activating feelings of despair. This research investigates the possibility that messages which combine threats along with messages that encourage enthusiasm might be a more effective and encourage increased participation. Given findings that indicate strong public support for policies that deny rights to others, especially in times of crisis, it is important to assess how specific message strategies can influence citizen participation, especially as the electorate becomes more diverse. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Conventional wisdom posits that political participation is often facilitated by messages of threats. This research extends that work, arguing that appeals based primarily on crises may actually be counter-productive to political mobilization. Previous work finds that fear appeals were unsuccessful in the absence of an effective alternative to the threat. This research will study the corresponding effect on political mobilization by including alternative positive messages along with threat messages. The PI argues that a message strategy combining threat and opportunity cues can lead to a greater sense of political efficacy among individuals. Focusing on immigration policy, the PI will assess the attitudinal effects of different messaging strategies by administering two survey experiments, and by analyzing Latino-only survey responses from the American National Election Study. The PI expects that a message combining elements of threat and opportunity is a significant catalyst for increased political participation, especially among women. This research provides indicates strong support for the proposition that more balanced political messages are at least as successful at motivating participation among an under-represented group in American politics.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: In biology, a signal is passed from one biomolecule to another, such as in antigen-antibody interactions, or between a protein and DNA, and this function is transmitted via molecular interactions between their molecular structures. The result, in each case, is manifested as part of life's function. Similarly, in this project, peptides (small proteins) with short amino acid sequences will be designed and engineered to induce signal transduction into single atomic layer solids. As a consequence, the functions of the devices made from these thin solids will be monitored and controlled by carefully designed peptide sequences. Since the devices will be interfaced with peptides, they could be integrated with biosensors and bioenergetics devices of the future. The project will be executed at the cross-sections of diverse scientific fields such as molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, physics, mathematics and engineering. The research, therefore, is expected to result in the development of novel experimental and computational tools that will enable the design of hybrid bio/solid devices, creating a common scientific language that could be used collectively in these diverse and convergent fields. The project will establish research training opportunities for the next generation of creative scientists who will be unique members of interdisciplinary engineers and technologists contributing to the continuing tradition of creativity, the hallmark of innovation in the USA. The transformative nature of the project will also lead to advanced intellectual properties and patents, enhancing the competitive edge of the USA at the global platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The key reason for this project is the shortcoming of knowledge of how biology interacts with man-made solids at the molecular scale. Despite numerous studies in this major topic, the understanding has so far been far from complete. This knowledge is essential to integrate devices with living systems, for example, for future health monitoring. Based on the collective expertise and facilities of the investigators, the project addresses these limitations by three major innovations: coded recognition of simple crystals, such as single atomic layer materials, by peptides; designed functional moieties via state-of-the-art predictive computational modeling and genetics; and, finally, advanced test-bed demonstrations of hybrid devices. Controlling the intrinsic properties of materials using simple biomolecules, i.e., engineered peptides, will be carried out by integrated experimental and computational approaches working iteratively and in tandem, in three Task Areas: Formation of self-organized structures of peptides on single atomic layer solids (Task-1), with interface structures and physical properties (predicted by advanced computational modeling) induced by biomolecular coding (Task-2), and interrogated by test-bed measurements (Task-3), for example in a field effect transistor. The overall work, therefore, will establish the foundations of biologically-coded physical properties of engineered solids. Finally, the bio/solid interfaces are also analogous to a famous technological problem, namely coherent interfaces in compound semiconductors developed during the 80s that enabled today's electronics (lap-top computers, cell phones, etc.,). It is conceivable that through this project a more complete understanding of the intricacies of the bio/nano interface structures, molecular recognition characteristics of different peptide sequences, and physical changes in the 2D materials across the interfaces, one can make major strides in the in vivo integration of the worlds of biology and solid-state devices of the future with unprecedented functionalities.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed to develop, test and validate a retractable telescopic structural wall for applications in flood protection. This technology will enable more resilient infrastructure in flood-prone areas. Climate change is creating a problem for coastal cities and local communities in proximity to large bodies of water. Population centers tend to be located near such bodies of water, and finding the space to accommodate increasing populations, as well as hazard-resilient infrastructure, represents a challenge for city officials and the engineering community in general. The addressable market size for this technology is estimated at $2.6 billion. The proposed concept, when validated, will provide a paradigm shift for the prefabricated concrete industry. It will also develop and validate new methods for telescopic interconnection of structural elements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in a unique concept where structural boxes, made out of fiber reinforced concrete, can be deployed telescopically to withstand forces imposed from external sources, and then return to a retracted position. The goals of the proposed research surround the detailed design of the mechanisms, determination of a geometric configuration and material mix to achieve a high strength-to-weight ratio, and the execution of laboratory experimentation and field tests on physical working prototypes. The plan to accomplish these goals starts with the development of numerical simulations and an analytical framework. Results will be validated via laboratory tests where lateral and vertical loads, as well as impact loads, will be applied. Field tests of the specimens will also be conducted to determine the effects of soil type on performance. These field tests will serve as well to simulate realistic still flood water conditions. The anticipated technical result of Phase I is a working prototype of the telescopic structural flood wall with extension and retraction capabilities, and with the structural capability to withstand the forces from flood events with minimal to no damage.</AbstractNarration>

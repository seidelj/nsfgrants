    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide travel grants for US-based students to attend the two day workshop on Programming: Logics, Models, Algorithms and Concurrency to be held at the University of Texas at Austin, April 29-30, 2016. This workshop will bring together leading researchers in the area of programming theory for distributed applications, from logic to models, from algorithms to concurrency, to present recent results and tutorials, bring the current research in perspective through an historical lens, and discuss the challenges ahead. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be open to graduate and undergraduate students, who will be able to attend talks and participate in discussions. Tutorials will provide them with a unique opportunity to gain perspective on the field through the eyes of the leaders who shaped it and to interact with and be inspired by them. Special emphasis will be placed on the participation of graduate and undergraduate women computer scientists and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

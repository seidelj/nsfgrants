    <AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. This award supports scientists at the University of California Los Angeles to carry out gamma-ray astrophysics research using an operating observatory and participate in the planning and development of the next generation gamma-ray observatory. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. The University of California Los Angeles group will contribute to the operation and maintenance of VERITAS and work on analysis and interpretation of the scientific data. The group is also involved in the development of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), an international gamma-ray observatory currently in planning stages. The group leads the development of the Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (SCT), a new technology to be implemented on CTA. They will operate a prototype SCT at the VERITAS site. The group will continue their existing education and outreach activities to high-school students with hands-on research involving data from VERITAS and the prototype SCT. They will also develop a citizen science program that will engage the public in exploring the data from the prototype SCT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of California Los Angeles group will use VERITAS to study Galactic sources, focusing on the Cygnus region and the Galactic Center, and to search for magnetic fields in cosmic voids. They will operate the prototype SCT alongside and in coordination with VERITAS to characterize and improve its performance. The group will continue to be involved in the definition and leadership of CTA through the technology development and top-level project management roles.</AbstractNarration>

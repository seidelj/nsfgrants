    <AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks funds to partially cover travel expenses of underrepresented young faculty and students as well as dissemination expenses related to the conference entitled, "NSF/ONR: Whither Turbulence and Big Data In the 21st Century" to be held in Corsica, France, April 20-24, 2015. World class researchers will participate in his meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities in turbulence involve the collection of massive amounts of data from multi-scale computer simulations and/or large-scale experiments. For example, highly non-linear time dependent stochastic turbulent flow experiments routinely produce terabytes of multi-modal data (velocity, pressure, temperature, acoustics, etc.) in fractions of a second. Such computational and experimental research presents formidable big data challenges and overcoming them is indeed critical for achieving real breakthroughs. Better understanding of turbulence will lead to improved understanding of a number of engineering problems in aerospace and naval applications, biomedical applications, wind energy production, energy conservation, etc. The symposium will include breakout sessions each day to maximize interaction among participants. The organizing committee is committed to engage senior minority PhDs and junior faculty. &lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this workshop is to frame the challenges in big data and turbulence research fluid dynamics for the next several. Other objectives of the symposium are as follows: (i) The symposium seeks to bring awareness and basic knowledge on the state-of-the-art fluid dynamics research including: modeling, experiments, and simulations; (ii) The symposium will provide a unique cross-disciplinary environment for identifying the current issues and challenges of turbulence for the next quarter century; (iii) It will foster collaborations and students exchange with USA, Canada, Europe and Australia; (iv) It will enable the development of strategies and new initiatives for data reduction and visualization; including Cyber Infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

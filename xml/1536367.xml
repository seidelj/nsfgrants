    <AbstractNarration>This project will support a workshop for new and future Principal Investigators (PI's) in the Condensed Matter Physics Program within the NSF Division of Materials Research. The workshop will be held in Arlington, VA on June 1st and 2nd, 2015. The workshop will provide PI's who have just received their first award, or are attempting to obtain funding, from the CMP program with valuable information and advice on the policies, procedures and opportunities available at the National Science Foundation. The workshop will focus on:&lt;br/&gt;- Individual Investigator Programs in DMR&lt;br/&gt;- DMR Centers&lt;br/&gt;- DMR Facilities&lt;br/&gt;- Other user facilities&lt;br/&gt;- Special DMR programs&lt;br/&gt;- NSF Policies and Procedures&lt;br/&gt;- The Merit Review Process&lt;br/&gt;- What makes a review effective and helpful&lt;br/&gt;- Preparing highlights&lt;br/&gt;- Preparing successful proposals&lt;br/&gt;as well as other topics of interest to new PI's.

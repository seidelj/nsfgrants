    <AbstractNarration>1500815&lt;br/&gt;Srivastava&lt;br/&gt;University of Idaho&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rare earth elements (REE) are considered critical materials because of their essential usage in a variety of business sectors and their potential for supply shortages and scarcity. Recovery of REE from waste streams and end-of-life products is an attractive technology, however separation of REE from these materials can be costly and involve toxic and hazardous chemicals. Microorganisms have the capacity to selectively accumulate and fractionate metals including REE but have not been deployed as a separation technology for REE. The PI proposes to develop a high risk high payoff platform technology based on microfluidic separation using dielectrophoresis (DEP). The proposed work is anticipated to transform the screening of biomaterials by providing a highly adaptable means for high-throughput screening of superior performing biomaterials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will be accomplished through 1) utilizing computational fluid dynamics to design and simulate a variety of DEP microdevices as a means for separation of OHMs and, 2) construction and validation of the microdevice using two very different model microorganisms, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and Cupriavidus necator. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Development of a rapid screening tool for identification and separation of these high performing organisms would significantly enhance and accelerate screening and development of microorganisms used in biosorption of all types, not just specific to metals; providing a greener and potentially more cost effective technological solution to separation challenges.</AbstractNarration>

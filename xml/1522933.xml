    <AbstractNarration>Objective:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to explore, uncover, and control the rich nonlinear and quantum dynamics of light propagation that arise because of the presence of multiple, nonlinearly-coupled modes in multimode optical waveguides. This research is transformative in that it establishes a rigorous theoretical and experimental framework of this uncharted territory to develop fundamental understanding and to investigate novel device application.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, efficient generation of quantum-entangled photon pairs in nonlinear multimode optical fibers will be explored in detail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to develop a parallel theoretical and experimental platform that integrates fundamental research on nonlinear and quantum dynamics of multimode waveguides with novel device applications.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is in response to the emerging needs of the photonics community for a rigorous and comprehensive treatment of the nonlinear and quantum aspects of light propagation in multimode optical waveguides, such as in the emerging field of multimode-multiplexed fiber-optic communications for ultra-high-data-rate transmission, and for better security in quantum cryptography using the modal-entanglement platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to obtain the mastery of nonlinear and quantum phenomena in multimode waveguides, which is vital to the national security and technological competitiveness of the United States for the development of the next generation of optical communication devices; and to integrate cutting-edge research with education using initiatives that include curriculum development, expansion of the photonics teaching laboratory, and continuing with the annual summer workshop program for teachers of the Milwaukee Public Schools system.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides domestic and international travel support for U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 22nd ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2016), which will be held in San Francisco, CA, USA from August 13-17, 2016. KDD is the world?s premier conference in data science. It is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together ~2000 researchers and practitioners every year from all aspects of data mining, knowledge discovery, and large-scale data analytics. A strong representation of U.S. researchers, particularly students, at the conference is essential in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area today and into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is a highly selective meeting that includes oral and poster presentations of refereed papers as well as panel discussions and invited talks by the leading experts. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences. The total number of KDD participants in recent years has been in excess of 2200, with a majority of the participants being from the U.S., followed by Europe and Asia. For the selection of awardees, the selection committee will put particular emphasis on diversity. As in various STEM fields, increasing the diversity of participants at KDD is a primary goal.</AbstractNarration>

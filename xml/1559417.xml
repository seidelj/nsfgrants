    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the travel of US participants, in particular students and early career researchers, to attend a graduate student workshop (Introduction to Relative Aspects in Representation Theory, Langlands Functoriality and Automorphic Forms, May 16-20, 2016) and/or a conference (Relative Trace Formula, Periods, L-Functions and Harmonic Analysis May 23-27, 2016) at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Luminy, France. The workshop will consist primarily of four series of four lectures given by some of the leading experts in the area of automorphic representations and is aimed at graduate students. The conference will include 10-15 invited talks by leading researchers. In addition to the invited talks there will be ample opportunities for young researchers to present and discuss their work in both formal and informal settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms and Langlands functoriality are active and important areas of research that involve applying the methods of representation theory to classical problems in number theory and harmonic analysis. The workshop and conference focus especially on matters that involve periods of automorphic forms and harmonic analysis on symmetric spaces. Much of the impetus for the workshop is derived from work related to relative trace formulas and the associated theory over local fields.

    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to develop a bootstrap multigrid algorithmic framework that has the potential to make an appreciable and broad impact on computational methods for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The intellectual merit of the project derives from its potential to make several distinct theoretical advances in the design and analysis of geometric and algebraic multigrid methods and to integrate those advances into algorithms and software for large-scale scientific applications that require solving coupled PDE systems and PDE eigenvalue problems. The broader impact of the project will be realized by applying these new algorithms to various problems in science and engineering. The graduate student and post doc involved in the project will engage in interdisciplinary research led by the PI and will have opportunities to visit and work with colleagues from industry and DOE labs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project builds on recent advances by the PI in the development of multigrid solvers for systems of and PDE eigenvalue problems: (1) the successful development of adaptive and bootstrap algebraic multigrid as fast solvers for the Wilson-Dirac and Wilson-clover discretizations of the coupled Dirac PDE in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD); (2) the design and analysis of a robust bootstrap MG solver for the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalue problem. Specifically, the project team will focus on two interrelated research goals: (1) to extend the bootstrap algebraic MG methods currently being used to solve various discretizations of the Dirac PDE to a general approach for solving systems of coupled PDEs and generalized algebraic eigenvalue problems; (2) to design and analyze new finite element bootstrap MG methods for solving PDE eigenvalue problems on surfaces.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Mississippi Valley State University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines. This project seeks to increase the number of undergraduate STEM majors being prepared to enter graduate school in a STEM field by focusing on mathematics preparation and to provide professional development to pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers. It is noteworthy that most students who enter the university come from secondary school systems where they have been taught mathematics by teachers who did not hold a mathematics or mathematics education degree. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to: increase the number of STEM majors going to graduate school; increase the mathematics content knowledge related to Common Core State Standards for Mississippi Delta area teachers using a collaborative team approach; and to prepare military veteran students to major in STEM disciplines. The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-based. They include a support structure for students, undergraduate student research, curriculum development, teachers clinics, and a veterans' initiative. Seventy pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers are involved in professional development activities in the Teachers Teaching Teachers Clinics. The project is guided by an on-going evaluation, as well as internal and external advisory boards. This project is co-funded by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>1619523 &lt;br/&gt;Diwekar, Urmila M.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The food production system generates waste streams that are characterized by high concentrations of organic matter, nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing species in water. Therefore, monitoring nitrogen and phosphorous species is important for water quality requirements for agricultural as well as energy recovery from waste streams. Currently these species are monitored via stationary monitoring stations. However nitrogen and phosphorous species move via agricultural run-off to other water systems, so portable sensors are needed that can change positionsin real time. This type of dynamic sensing requires suitable algorithms that can calculate appropriate sensor locations in real time in the face of inherent uncertainties in the fate and transport of the relevant species. To develop such an algorithmic framework to solve the problem of sensor placement in real time is the objective of this research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is targeted to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationships involved in sensor placement and interaction with nutrient fate and transport of relevant species, with the goal of identifying the number and spatio-temporal positions of sensors for maximum effectiveness. Given that uncertainty is inherent, the problem of sensor placement will be formulated as a dynamic stochastic programming problem, the solution of which will be the dynamic optimal sensor deployment policy for nutrient monitoring in the face of uncertainties. Dynamic sensing with portable low cost sensors is a new area for nutrient monitoring which shows promise for food-water-energy nexus. This research will provide a theoretical basis for such an endeavor. This real time sensor placement problem will allow for the study of the spatial-temporal aspect of pollution which a constant monitoring station does not provide.</AbstractNarration>

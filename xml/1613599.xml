<AbstractNarration>The LSAMP program began in 1991 as a multidisciplinary comprehensive undergraduate program designed to increase substantially the number of minority students receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM field. Awards have grown from 6 alliances to 45 state and regional alliances which encompass more than 600 institutions. The program is considered by many to be the crown-jewel of broadening participation programs. The knowledge of how LSAMP was able to accomplish this incredible feat needs a forum where the stakeholders can highlight to the nation NSF's LSAMP strategy and help to build the knowledge base on models and evidenced-based approaches to recruitment and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is an important step in advancing the knowledge of underrepresented minority students in STEM through the LSAMP project directors. The experiences gained by principal investigators working with other science and education faculty will position them to address the nation's great challenge of producing more minority scientists. Reviewing the rich history of the past twenty five (25) years of a successful program will contribute to the nation's understanding of effective practices that contribute to the trajectories of minority scientists in both research and the professoriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, through implementation of this conference, broadens participation of underrepresented groups in graduate and undergraduate education with the real prospect of increasing the number of such groups attaining doctoral and other degrees in STEM and entering the professoriate. Discovery and understanding resulting from this conference will enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Description: The ability to manipulate properties of light beams has changed our understanding of the physical universe. Photon beams are being explored to process information, probe the nature of solids and understand how the brain responds to and interacts with external stimuli. New semiconductors that interact with light in unusual ways often form the cornerstone for enhancing the effective coupling of photons to matter. The project investigates the potential of new semiconducting oxide systems in emerging photonic devices. The research goal is to explore optical and electronic properties of thin film SmNiO3 that has a controllable phase change near room temperature that can be systematically induced by changing the electronic structure for potential applications in optoelectronic devices such as optical modulators and optical memories. The project is collaborative between materials scientists and photonics engineers to bring multi-disciplinary skills together to work on cutting-edge topics in nanophotonics incorporating new thin film oxide materials. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students to carry out research at the intersection between materials science, nanophotonics, and optoelectronics. The project engages diverse students in interdisciplinary research that encompasses materials growth, device design, computer modeling, cleanroom nanofabrication, and optical/electronic characterization of materials/devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: This project investigates the potential of electron-doped perovskites as novel phase-changing materials for future light modulation devices needed for optical memory, brain-inspired photonic devices with multiple states. The research goals of this collaborative project are to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms and reliability of non-volatility of the electron incorporation process and to understand the limits on the speed of phase change studied by optical routes. The research team uses a combination of thin film materials synthesis, electron diffraction, carrier transport measurements, optical microscopy and spectroscopy to study the nanostructure and optical properties of selected perovskite oxides. The research team uses ?metasurfaces?, which are two-dimensional arrays of optical antennas, to maximize the interaction between intensely confined light and thin films of phase-change materials. The project involves diverse graduate and undergraduate students to work on frontier topics in nanophotonics. Collaborations between materials scientists and photonics researchers enhances the research experience and broaden the technical horizons of the participating students.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>An international conference on K-theory, Cyclic Homology and Motives will be held at Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey in New Brunswick, NJ from August 19 through August 22, 2015. The conference will bring together senior researchers from around the world with young mathematicians to exchange the most recent developments in the field and facilitate scientific interaction. NSF funds will support participants that do not have access to grant funds of their own, with a particular emphasis on supporting the participation of graduate students and recent graduates from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There have recently been major advances in several directions within the subject proposed for the conference, work which has led to numerous new questions and research programs. Among these are: the work on the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures and the new techniques introduced for it, including a useable category of motives and motivic homotopy theory; the introduction of algebraic cobordism and its use in proving degree formulas; advances on and applications of trace methods; progress on the Farrell-Jones and Baum-Connes isomorphism conjectures and applications in geometric topology. The goal of the conference is to explore the connections between these research projects and share methods and techniques as well as the newest results.

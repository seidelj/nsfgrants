    <AbstractNarration>Morgan State University will investigate the impact of a concept mapping strategy in introductory biology courses on the retention and academic success of underrepresented students. The researchers hypothesize students experiencing greater success in introductory biology by constructing concept maps and using them as an active learning tool will more likely be retained as a STEM major. The impact of concept mapping will be measured by investigating the correlations among course grades in two biology courses, mapping skill, ability to think big, motivation, and retention rates. The conceptual framework for the proposed project incorporates theories that support the efficacy of purposely creating an active learning environment that centers on the use of concept learning maps. The research has the potential to transform the biology learning environment from teacher-centered to student-centered with a focus on meaningful learning thereby increasing retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will use a mixed-methods approach involving four classes and 30-40 faculty to answer two research questions: (1) What are the measurable impacts of using concept maps on metacognition and motivation among underrepresented students in introductory biology courses. (2) What are the correlations among course grades, mapping skill, metacognition, and motivation as well as retention and completion rates in upper-level biology courses? They will collect quantitative data using two survey instruments and qualitative data using classroom observations of concept mapping and semi-structured interviews with faculty. The research findings are expected to yield insights to reverse the attrition in introductory gatekeeper biology courses for STEM majors and, ultimately, provide an alternative model for improving overall student success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Broadening Participation Research in Education track. This program track supports ideas to create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning, investigate the underlying issues affecting the differential participation and success rates of students from underrepresented groups, and produce knowledge to inform STEM education practices and interventions.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this program is to use the Dark Energy Survey (DES) supernova sample to study photometric classification of supernova candidates (i.e. classifying supernovae based on how they appear at different wavelengths of light) and to study correlations between supernova brightness and host galaxy properties. The large sample will enable detailed studies of systematic uncertainties due to the wide range of observed supernova properties and the environment they explode in, leading to improved measurements of the expansion history of the Universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students. The PI will also work with advanced undergraduate students to create new in-class demonstrations and structured learning activities that will help reform the introductory physics classes at Penn.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Northern New Mexico College (Northern) is establishing a dedicated research network fabric and Science DMZ that is: 1) connecting multiple teaching and research laboratories serving biology, chemistry, environmental science, and engineering; and 2) improving the capacity and efficiency of moving Terabytes (TBs) of data sets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed network upgrades are permitting faculty and students to engage in high-throughput data analysis research. High-speed switches are allowing TBs of data transfers from storage nodes to multiple labs, including solar energy variables needed to analyze irradiance and solar power generation patterns; data sets of 3-D convection simulation computed by Northern's Aguila parallel Supercomputer; and TBs of ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing needed to understand the role of Cajal Bodies in the biogenesis of non-coding RNA in land plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Northern serves a 72% Hispanic and 11% Native American student population. Northern?s recent development of Engineering, Biology, and Environmental Science programs has greatly increased access to four-year STEM degrees for northern New Mexicans. This CC*DNI project represents the next step in closing the STEM education gap that prevents Hispanics, the fastest growing ethnic group in the nation's labor force, and Native Americans from entering STEM professions. The remote experimental control features to lab equipment are also addressing the geographic challenge of campus access for students living in remote mountain villages, especially during winter months, and is allowing for the development of remote undergraduate research experiences known to support the success of minority populations studying STEM.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>A control paradigm based on the emergence of synchronization in complex networks of coupled heterogeneous oscillators is proposed for low-inertia microgrids with increased renewable generation. The key idea pertains to controlling power electronic inverters to emulate the dynamics of nonlinear limit cycle oscillators. The oscillators (inverters) are coupled (connected) through the existing microgrid electrical network, and synchrony emerges in this system with no external forcing such as from a utility grid nor any communication beyond the natural interactions within the existing physical electrical network. Since an emergent phenomenon governs the overarching control philosophy, the proposed paradigm is resilient, robust, modular, and amenable to a plug-and-play implementation in ad-hoc microgrids with variable renewable generation and uncertain loads. The educational opportunities in mathematics, physics, and circuit theory associated with the project are particularly exciting, since research themes are inspired by fascinating synchronization phenomena that continue to captivate the creative and collective imaginations of engineers, physicists, mathematicians, and biologists worldwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks groundbreaking advances in the control of power electronics inverters to enable low-inertia microgrids with increased renewable generation. The underlying technical approach is based on a control- and circuit-theoretic viewpoint of emergent synchronization phenomena that are inherent in complex networks of coupled heterogeneous oscillators. The proposed research thrusts span the relevant modeling and analysis challenges to formalize the design approach, pertinent synchronization problems in complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic electrical networks, and implementation issues relating to satisfying load and source requirements. These thrusts afford the twin objectives of advancing the theory of synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators, while leveraging theoretic findings in establishing advanced control paradigms for robust, resilient and sustainable microgrids.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program as well as the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Dalice Pinero from the University Puerto Rico Rio Piedras and colleague Vilmali Lopez-Mejias have acquired a crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a copper source.  Crystal diffraction is a powerful modern tool to determine the atomic structure of solid materials from small but relevant molecules to polymers and biological materials such as pharmaceuticals, natural products and DNA. The instrument is used in undergraduate research projects and in thesis projects of graduate students. The structural information enables researchers to understand the behavior and properties of the substances they synthesize, isolate and characterize. This information impacts the advance of basic science and technological progress from manufacturing of nanomaterials, pharmaceuticals and many other substances used in everyday life. The diffractometer is housed at the University of Puerto Rico's Molecular Sciences Research Center (UPR-MSRC), establishing a complete state-of-the-art X-ray diffraction facility that supports the research and educational efforts of multiple scientists across the metropolitan area of the island of Puerto Rico. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The single crystal X-ray diffractometer is used in structural analysis of solid materials. It is aimed at enhancing research in a variety of areas including (a) synthesizing and characterizing magnetic materials for memory devices, sensors, and imaging agents, (b) designing applications and mechanistic studies for crystallization on surfaces, (c) designing a non-aldol approach towards the synthesis of polypropionate derived natural targets, (d) developing layered inorganic compounds as hosts for catalysts and drugs, (e) isolating and structurally elucidating marine natural products, (f) structurally characterizing pharmaceutical solid forms obtained in continuous crystallization processes, (g) synthesizing new transition metal complexes based on pyrene derivatives with promising applications in memory devices; and (h) synthesizing and characterizing aromatic heterocyclic compounds as potential  pharmacological agents.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>1510709 (Chen)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low temperature, lean combustion enables low emission levels and high efficiencies of combustion devices such automobiles and jet engines. The proposed study investigates the effect of electrical field on the fuel-lean combustion and seeks to extend the limit where extra-low temperature combustion is viable. It also integrates the research activities with the education programs of undergraduate and graduate students, aiming to provide a fundamental understanding of promising technologies to the next generation of engineers and scientists in the field of combustion science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mechanisms of flame support under stratified conditions are investigated with a combined numerical simulations and experimental approach, on the effect of an external electric field on the lean flammability limit and flame speed of a stratified methane flame. The goals are to investigate to what extent stable combustion can be maintained in practical devices while sustaining ultra-lean conditions and, specifically, to elucidate the relative contributions of thermal and chemical effects associated with transport in the vicinity of the flame. The experimental component will be used for validation of the models used in the simulations and to confirm the efficacy of the injection and ignition strategies. The new knowledge gained will form the basis for further gains in engine efficiency.</AbstractNarration>

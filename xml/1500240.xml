    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a motionless magnetic shape memory (MSM) micropump to fill the need for draining bodily fluids and delivering dosages with small, lightweight, and highly reliable micro fluidic pumps. The motionless MSM micropump is important because it enables dosage of micro fluids at higher precision and greater reliability which will advance research in many areas of biology, chemistry, and medicine. For instance the motionless MSM micropump will drain fluids from organs such as brain and lung continuously without or with minimally invasive surgery as opposed to removal of such fluids through repeated surgical interventions which is the current state of the art. The project will result in a scalable prototype of a motionless MSM micropump. This motionless MSM micropump has the following unique features: it is lightweight, actuated contact-free, and can transport a large range of volumes from picoliter to milliliter. These features provide advantages such as reliability, precision, versatility, contact-free actuation, low power consumption when compared to the leading competing peristaltic pumps and syringe pumps in this market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The MSM pumping concept was demonstrated in 2012 at a pump actuated by a rotating permanent magnet. The micropump makes use of a magnetic shape memory alloy that shape-shifts in response to a dynamic magnetic field. Researchers will replace the rotating magnet with a set of electrical coils and a yoke turning the pump into a solid state device without moving parts. This will simplify the design, enable further miniaturization, and reduce weight. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a post-doctoral engineering researcher and a MBA student, will receive experiences in innovation, product development and technology translation through combining a multifunctional, magneto-mechanical, smart material with electromagnetic field manipulation and through using a customer development process - namely the Lean Launchpad process - to build a sustainable business model around the motionless MSM micropump.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages the animal hospital WestVet to establish clinical needs for a micropump in context with bodily fluid drainage in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality. The project also engages Idaho TechHelp to connect the researchers with manufacturers in Idaho and the region.</AbstractNarration>

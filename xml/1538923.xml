    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial participant support for US junior scientists and members of under-represented minorities to participate in the 2015 Conference on Science at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) to be held on May 18-20, 2015 on the campus at the South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology in Rapid City, South Dakota. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will address the science that can be carried out at SURF: Neutrino Physics, Proton Decay, Nuclear Astrophysics, Dark Matter, Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay, Materials Science for Nuclear and Particle Physics, Geology, and Astrobiology and Life in Extreme Environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, the conference has a particular focus on junior scientists as well as scientists who are members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering (e.g., underrepresented minorities, women, and persons with disabilities). The PI is also working to encourage the participation of Native American students, scientists, and engineers in the conference. This conference is important in the education of young scientists not only because of the presentations they listen to, but also because during the meeting they directly communicate with the more experienced scientists who are in attendance.</AbstractNarration>

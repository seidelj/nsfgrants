    <AbstractNarration>The problem of ensuring that computer hardware is not surreptitiously malicious is a growing concern. The case of random number generators (RNGs) is particularly important because random numbers are foundational to information security. All current solutions in practice require trusting the hardware, and are therefore vulnerable to hardware attacks. This project explores a quantum-based solution to hardware security by designing and implementing a new class of RNGs that can prove their own integrity to the user. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate randomness generation in several settings: using a perfect seed, using a weak seed, and distributed key distribution. The goals are to achieve a high level of security with a minimal set of assumptions. The approach is based on Bell inequality violations and builds upon the investigators previous theoretical results. This project develops new methods for both the mathematical analysis and experimental techniques in order to close the gaps between theory and practice. The contributions include new insights and techniques for proving quantum security and for overcoming practical challenges for realizing Bell violations. This new approach could pioneer a new application domain and train an early generation of diversified practitioners for the rapidly growing quantum information technology industry.</AbstractNarration>

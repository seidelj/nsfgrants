    <AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for the PPoPP 2016, CGO 2016, and HPCA 2016 Symposia Co-located in Barcelona, Spain&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to three co-located conferences: the ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP 2016), the International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2016), and the International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2016). The conferences are being held in Barcelona, Spain, during March 12--16 2016. These conferences are top-ranked in the fields of parallel programming, compilers, and computer architecture. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include fostering the next generation of researchers in these research areas, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise. The student selection process takes into account both merit and financial need, and requires support letters written by academic advisors. A strong emphasis is put on supporting women and underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

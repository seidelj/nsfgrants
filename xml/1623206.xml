    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University seeks to utilize active learning approaches in courses in biomedical and chemical engineering and incorporate research into the curriculum. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the specific goals to: increase the number of pre-engineering students that choose an engineering major; increase the number of students that choose the materials science option; increase the number of students participating in undergraduate research; and prepare students to pursue graduate studies and/or enter the workforce. To achieve the goals, the project will: infuse modules and laboratory experiments in materials science into fourteen existing undergraduate courses in chemical and biomedical engineering; and involve undergraduate students and faculty in research investigating the consequences of structure-function relationships in nanoparticle suspensions. The project could serve as a model for small departments that are trying to grow enrollment, while at the same time keeping faculty engaged in research.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the provision of a scientifically-based, gender-specific, home-based, mobile health secondary prevention (SP) program for women with heart disease with greater access at a lower cost than current center-based SP programs. This application will overcome barriers to currently available center-based programs. The innovation will provide a solution to the healthcare triple aim of 1) improving quality of care; 2) improving population health; and 3) reducing per capita cost. The application is a timely business opportunity starting with a recurring software subscription model that will provide better service, at a lower cost to women with heart disease.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will translate the core modules of center-based secondary prevention (SP) into a comprehensive, patient-centered, gender-specific mobile health program for cardiovascular risk reduction including emotional and physical assessment, training videos, symptom monitoring, coaching and communication with a healthcare provider, and outcome evaluation. The intellectual merit of this project is evident in that the mobile innovation will incorporate theory-based behavior change techniques known to drive changes in health behaviors, demonstrate the intended behavior, tailored to women with heart disease versus apparently healthy individuals, and will undergo evaluation in a randomized clinical trial. The application incorporates self-monitoring, user selection of priority goals, motivational strategies and will requires less patient and staff time.</AbstractNarration>

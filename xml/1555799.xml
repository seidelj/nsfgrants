    <AbstractNarration>This project will support a workshop that aims to address the role of distributed spectrum measurements and associated management techniques in support of making significantly more spectrum available to the U.S. population. New spectrum management approaches and spectrum sharing regimes promise to provide greater broadband access, accelerate the pace of wireless innovation, and increase the competitiveness of the US telecommunication industry and U.S. commerce in general. This workshop will result in the promotion of research and educational efforts that enhance our ability to use spectrum sharing technologies in a manageable and enforceable manner. This work is supportive of the goals set out in the National Broadband Plan, the PCAST Report on Spectrum Policy and the two associated Presidential Memorandums on Spectrum issued in the past 8 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will assess the current state of spectrum measurement techniques, the datasets that have been collected and importantly the analysis and modeling tools available to make this data useful and actionable. This should in turn provide the basis for developing a roadmap for research leading to future spectrum management, monitoring, and enforcement techniques and policies that will enable greater and more efficient access to our increasingly scarce national spectrum resources.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The volume and complexity of scientific data continue to grow rapidly. New astronomical surveys will result in datasets much larger than those previously available. This poses new challenges for data-driven discovery. It also enables new opportunities for interdisciplinary research. Astronomy is at the forefront in creating "pi-shaped" data scientists. These people have both science expertise and cross-disciplinary knowledge. Many other fields also see the need for such pi-shaped scientists. The La Serena School for Data Science 2017-2021 will introduce undergraduates and graduates to the tools and techniques they need. They will be ready just in time for the large scientific projects of 2020 and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The existence of enormous (peta-scale) datasets coming from wide-area and time-domain astronomical surveys poses significant concerns for data-driven discovery, access, and analysis, even while enabling new opportunities for interdisciplinary research in applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and related topics. Astronomy provides a sandbox where scientists can come together from diverse fields to address common challenges within the "Big Data" paradigm. The one-week La Serena School, each year from 2017 to 2021, will train the next generation of scientists in astronomy, biomedicine, computer science, statistics, and mathematics, from the US, Chile and other countries, in the tools and techniques of massive data. With the experience gained from this school, participants will be prepared to lead the exploration of the extremely large datasets of tomorrow. The pilot schools, held from 2013 to 2015, were very successful, both demonstrating the demand, and building a strong foundation for collaboration between the NSF and Chilean institutions. This award will bring 15-18 U.S. students, roughly half of the class each year, to Chile for a combination of learning about massive data and working side-by-side with their Latin-American and other international colleagues. Support for the schools is shared with a diverse set of Chilean institutions. NSF funding is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays. VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources. This award provides funding to continue VERITAS operations. During this time the Observatory will complete a program designed to address themes in Particle Physics and Fundamental Laws, Black Holes, Cosmology, and Galactic Particle Accelerators. This award will also support the VERITAS collaboration efforts to engage the public in science. These include collaboration with the Whipple Observatory Visitors Center to promote VERITAS science to the public, other educators, museum professionals and the wider community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VERITAS is an array of four 12-meter atmospheric-Cherenkov Telescopes. VERITAS seeks both to identify new sources of high energy gamma rays, and to perform in-depth studies of the known sources to better understand their underlying fundamental processes. The primary targets of VERITAS Galactic observations are supernova remnants, pulsars, binary systems, and sources whose classification is unknown. The extragalactic targets observed by VERITAS include active galactic nuclei, radio galaxies, starburst galaxies, galaxy clusters, globular clusters and gamma-ray bursts. In addition, Local Group galaxies, the Galactic Center and dwarf spheroidal galaxies and are targets of VERITAS observations focused on the indirect detection of cold dark matter.</AbstractNarration>

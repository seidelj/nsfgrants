    <AbstractNarration>The Entrepreneurial Game Studio at Drexel University seeks to design and prototype a mixed reality activity, Hacktion, to increase people's knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity best practices. This research and development project integrates the real world, in particular urban landscapes, with a digital world via GPS-enabled mobile devices, similar to popular commercial apps like Pokemon Go. In this prototype project, the city becomes the activity space. Participants must move within close proximity of a building - which, in the prototype, represents a server - and probe it using simulated cybersecurity methods. The app asks learners to engage physically and mentally with the learning tasks they face, increasing their understanding of cybersecurity and computer science. Hacktion is an educational experience that takes learning into an informal setting of the streets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pervasive mixed-reality (PMR) games are a revolutionary and highly experimental approach to interactive entertainment. These games have been made possible only through technological advances in GPS accuracy, fast, reliable mobile networks, and powerful mobile operating systems that have occurred over the last five years. This research project will utilize the convergence of these relatively new mass market technologies to create an experimental PMR educational game about cybersecurity that is fun, engaging, and encourages physical activity. Instead of relying on the conventional drill-and-practice approach commonly found in educational games, this project requires players to learn about cybersecurity by analyzing company servers that are represented by local landmarks in the world around them. This combination of pervasive mixed-reality games, mobile technologies, and physical activity represents the vanguard of experimental work in the fields of both educational games and cybersecurity education.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The activities conducted through this project will help community college leaders to make the important connections and partnerships necessary to build and sustain their STEM programs, as well as to mentor and nurture new collaborations. The proposed activities will help to strengthen and expand the role of the nation's community colleges as they continue to meet the increasing demand for a trained technical workforce; play a critical role in addressing the national student completion agenda in STEM fields; and face the challenges of maintaining U.S. global competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project broadens the impact of community college leadership in STEM technician education; encourages greater numbers of community colleges to develop and strengthen ATE-related programs; creates and supports venues for developing and nurturing STEM professional and leadership development opportunities; and disseminates the value, resources, and accomplishments of the ATE program. The following proposed activities build upon AACC's previous efforts supported by the National Science Foundation: 1) Three National ATE Principal Investigators Conferences in 2017, 2018, and 2019; 2) Continuation of AACC's successful MentorLinks program to help an additional 10 community colleges establish new programs or strengthen existing ones in STEM fields; 3) An online publication documenting Strategies for Successful STEM Mentoring, based on the MentorLinks mentor training model and mentoring guidelines; 4) A national Thought Leaders' Summit and proceedings report focused on implementing evidence-based teaching strategies for supporting student success in STEM among underrepresented students; 5) Dissemination of ATE program resources, information, and impact through presentations, feature stories, website, conference proceedings, and social media technologies; and 6) Evaluation, including a longitudinal study of the 44 colleges (and 17 representative mentors) that participated in the MentorLinks program from 2002-2016.</AbstractNarration>

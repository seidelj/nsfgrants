    <AbstractNarration>In the era of big-data, one needs to organize massive amounts of data &lt;br/&gt;so that it can be searched quickly. This requires the building of an &lt;br/&gt;index over the raw data. In many cases of big-data, like world-wide web&lt;br/&gt;or DNA sequencing, the actual information content is low. This data is &lt;br/&gt;highly compressible. On the other hand, the indexes require space which &lt;br/&gt;is several times the raw data. Thus, indexing and compression are often &lt;br/&gt;conflicting goals. The field of compact (or succinct) data structures &lt;br/&gt;attempts to achieve both these goals -compression and indexability- &lt;br/&gt;simultaneously. This project will address some of the most fundamental &lt;br/&gt;open problems in this field. This will have impact on next generation &lt;br/&gt;biological sequence mining databases which could simply work within the &lt;br/&gt;memory of a PC instead of requiring high-performance clusters. The &lt;br/&gt;foundations built by this project will also impact image matching and &lt;br/&gt;music retrieval. Since data structures is one of the most fundamental &lt;br/&gt;areas in computer science education, research from this project will &lt;br/&gt;also impact data structures curriculum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suffix trees are central to string indexing and have myriads of &lt;br/&gt;applications. However, suffix trees are known to take 15 to 50 times &lt;br/&gt;the size of the text they index. This actually stems from a complexity &lt;br/&gt;gap in the size of data which is n log s bits compared to the size of &lt;br/&gt;the index which is O( n log n) bits, for the text of n characters drawn &lt;br/&gt;from alphabet size of s. The techniques of Burrows-Wheeler Transform(BWT)&lt;br/&gt;and Phi-function were introduced in the last decade to address this gap. &lt;br/&gt;Most subsequent research in this field has treated BWT as a black box, &lt;br/&gt;compressing augmenting structures around it to address various &lt;br/&gt;applications. However, many problems (like parameterized pattern matching&lt;br/&gt;and 2D pattern matching) have remained open in this field. This project &lt;br/&gt;will attempt to go deeper and beyond the philosophy of BWT to solve such &lt;br/&gt;issues. It will also try to build foundations for deriving lower bounds &lt;br/&gt;for problems where compact index would be impossible. To create better &lt;br/&gt;understanding of data structure space and query complexity, the project &lt;br/&gt;will explore the recent theoretical model called "encoding model". The &lt;br/&gt;project will also explore the applied case of compressed indexing for &lt;br/&gt;highly repetitive sequences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at: &lt;br/&gt;http://csc.lsu.edu/~rahul/succinct</AbstractNarration>

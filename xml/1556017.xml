    <AbstractNarration>The 2015 WiFiUS workshop and principal investigator meeting is held on December 10, 2015, in San Diego, California, USA. This meeting convenes all the principal investigators who have been jointly funded through the WiFiUS program by the National Science Foundation of US and either Tekes or The Academy of Finland of Finland. This is the first of two annual meetings specified in the WiFiUS NSF program solicitation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting offers an opportunity for the principal investigators, industry representatives, and funding agencies representatives, to review the research progress of the funded projects, identify new research directions, discuss the spectrum of the research projects allowing for identification of gaps and/or overlaps, and enabling cross-fertilization of the projects. The meeting is also open for the general research community members, who are not funded by the program, to attend and participate in the discussions and group break-out sessions, thus helping build a community of diverse international research collaborators. This workshop helps create and foster a vibrant international research and education community in the key area of wireless networking. Given how the world is increasingly connected, and the convergence towards a single set of global wireless standards, this workshop enhances and accelerates the innovation and collaboration between the teams of researchers, and helps to identify future directions for international research efforts.</AbstractNarration>

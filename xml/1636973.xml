    <AbstractNarration>Electronically commutated motors (ECMs) are used widespread in several applications including heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, cooling and refrigeration units. The conventional way of control and diagnostics of ECMs in existing systems have been done manually and require interruption of regular operation of these units. This increases the associated cost and time for maintenance, control and diagnostics of ECMs. This proposal requests support to commercialize a wireless data acquisition system that has been developed for control and diagnostics of electronically commutated motors (ECMs) that can lead to energy and cost savings with improved electric machine parameters. The proposed technology provides several benefits including cost and energy savings, and eliminates the need for the manual control and periodic maintenance of ECMs. The proposed technology will facilitate significantly the maintenance of these units in millions of HVAC systems, refrigeration and cooling units by providing wireless access to ECM parameters for collection of the required machine performance parameters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The innovation in the proposed technology introduces Bluetooth communication with novel antenna implementation into ECMs while they are in an enclosure and enables wireless communication to overcome this challenge. This is done with the design and implementation of novel and modular radio frequency (RF) interface circuit which is powered from the existing power electronics control circuitry of ECM in motor housing without impeding upon its performance. The novel RF circuit can be interfaced with the existing ECM systems or integrated during the manufacturing process. The accuracy of the communication is enhanced by using the reciprocal frequency counter method. This technology makes conventional ECM a "smart" ECM and gives them wireless communication capability with smart phones which have android or IOS software platforms. The proposed technology has potential customer groups including OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), service providers, distributors, and industrial, commercial automation and control providers for HVAC systems, refrigeration and cooling units. The funding will help the I-Corps project team to explore the areas further to expand the customer base and identify accurately the potential customers in the groups to have the right business model and plan execution.</AbstractNarration>

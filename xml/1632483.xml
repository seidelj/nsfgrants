    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project allows for the realization of a commercial millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring product that can help neurosurgeons in treating patients with hydrocephalus. While the goal of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of said ICP monitor, the technology can also be translated to the development of 'smart dust', opening up the next generation of computing paradigm. This will mark a significant milestone towards massive-scale realization of internet of things, dramatically accelerating the technology adoption and research impact of millimeter-scale wireless sensor nodes. The technology adoption can be introduced to multiple markets including, but not limited to, medical, industrial, and consumer spaces. This would open up many new commercial opportunities that were previously limited by energy consumption and size, heralding a new era of computing in an unprecedented form factor and lifetime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on the development of a millimeter-scale intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for improved treatment of hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the brain's ventricle area, causing head enlargement, epilepsy, and death. The only practical treatment for hydrocephalus is surgical implant of medical shunts, which relieves excess CSF to other parts of the body. The biggest problem with existing shunts is that they lack any embedded monitoring feature. Once the shunt is installed, there is no way to measure the internal pressure outside of hospital settings. The proposed monitor enables a 'smart shunt' solution, which continuously records ICP information inside the shunt for many years. This data is read out wirelessly and can be used to prevent shunt failures and improve the treatment of this lifelong disease.</AbstractNarration>

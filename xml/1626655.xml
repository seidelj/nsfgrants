    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation Award supports the acquisition of an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment with synchronized full-body motion tracking system to facilitate interdisciplinary research in human-machine interactions and enhanced teaching and student research training. This room-size virtual reality system provides multiple computer-generated displays that allow users to fully immerse and collaboratively interact with the simulated environment in real-time while the motion tracking system captures the user's physical movements. The VR system will enable several research studies across multiple disciplines to gain a better understanding of human-machine interactions and human motor skills and learning. This will lead to the development of technologies that enhance human mobility and function and foster collaborative operations between robots and humans. The research activities envisioned to be impacted by the acquisition of this system include those in rehabilitation, sports training, advanced manufacturing, and design of human-machine interfaces such as intelligent cockpits. The activities have a strong potential for technology transfer that can directly improve the quality of life for individuals in the community. Additionally, the instrumentation will provide an attractive resource for several outreach activities to motivate students to pursue a college career in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument is a turnkey, well-integrated CAVE virtual reality environment with a four-wall projection system, eight-camera real-time motion capture system with finger tracking capability, and a control software suite for customized software development and additional hardware integration. The instrumentation will enable fundamental research activities in several key areas. Researchers will investigate interaction models between humans and robots in a dynamic environment to develop effective control strategies for human-robot collaboration. Additional projects will study human perception, biomechanics of human movement under various stimuli, and development of assistive technologies and training protocols to enhance motor skills and learning. The instrumentation will also enable researchers to develop models and evaluation metrics for human interactions in complex environments that include multisensory feedback, perturbations, advanced modes of display, and multiple users. The VR system provides a cost-effective design solution that can be adapted, utilized, and evaluated to fit the needs of different projects that require a rich visual display that captures the dynamic variation in the real world.</AbstractNarration>

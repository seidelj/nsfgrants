    <AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for travel assistance of US participants to an international bilateral conference entitled "9th US-Japan Workshop on Advances in Organic/Inorganic Hybrid Materials," which will be held in Himeji, Japan on May 18th - 22nd, 2015. The co-organizers of this workshop are the PI (University of Arizona), Prof. Christine Luscombe (University of Washington), Prof. Ikuyoshi Tomita (Tokyo Institute of Technology), and Prof. Kensuke Naka (Kyoto Institute of Technology). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of this symposium are to showcase new research and application directions in the area of organic/inorganic hybrids, inorganic polymers, and nanocomposite materials. These materials are important as they exhibit unique and useful properties that enable applications central to sustainability, energy, homeland security, and other uses. The workshop will provide an interdisciplinary forum for the presentation of new and unpublished results in this area and provide a special opportunity to exchange ideas and information between leading US and Japanese researchers in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will enable an interdisciplinary and international venue to showcase new and previously unpublished results in the field of hybrid materials. It will highlight the importance and significance of NSF-funded research in this area while helping to promote new international collaborations. The talks, posters, and abstracts associated with this symposium will be used to educate new researchers in the field. This workshop will also serve as an in-depth educational and high-visibility forum for beginning investigators, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>By the end of the decade, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) will likely require all new vehicles to be Connected Vehicles (CV), capable of communicating with other vehicles and roadside infrastructure through wireless communications in order to reduce the number of crashes and save lives. The crash avoidance applications supported by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) connectivity exchange safety critical information such as speed, location and direction of movement to assess the crash risk based on the proximity of vehicles. While standards such as Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) will play a key role, other technologies such as WiFi, LTE (cellular), or other emerging technologies, can lower overall systems cost as well as supplement the availability, coverage, and peak data rate requirements of DSRC-based systems. The South Carolina Connected Vehicle Testbed (SC-CVT) is located along a 10-mile segment of Interstate I-85 near Clemson's International Center for Automotive Research (ICAR) campus in Greenville South Carolina. Two specific example CV applications that will be developed are traffic incident detection and queue warning. These two applications provide a convenient starting point for illustrating how CV applications can benefit from advanced network technology that integrates multiple wireless technologies in a CV system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are networks that integrate and exploit multiple concurrently available networking technologies. For critical applications requiring resource allocation optimization in order to meet safety-driven performance requirements. This project is using a combination of Software Defined Networking, local computing provided by GENI racks, and control based on statistical learning theory to demonstrate optimized HetNet operation on the SC-CVT.</AbstractNarration>

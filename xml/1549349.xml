    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will provide greater visibility into network behavior and help identify problems before they occur in the network. Advances in cloud computing and network virtualization are changing the way networks are designed and monitored. This project will help small and medium businesses adapt to and take advantage of these advances by means of intelligent analysis of network traffic data, resulting in an optimized network and eliminating unnecessary additional capital expenditure. The resulting commercial impact is that the technology will eliminate tedious data analysis currently required of network engineers to isolate fault and performance issues, and help them achieve a more efficient, streamlined design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on delivering a predictive network behavior analysis product that will help small and medium businesses better understand the behavior of their networks. Due to the rapid growth of new network technologies and increasing application complexity, such businesses have to constantly change and upgrade their networks. By not understanding the overall network behavior under various load conditions, they are forced to use ad-hoc methods to design and equip their networks. The objective of this project is to build a prototype that will demonstrate the proposed predictive network behavior analysis capability to potential customers. The prototype will also be used with select partners for beta testing and refining of requirements. The results will be used to further refine this prototype into a commercially viable product that can be deployed in the networks of small and medium businesses.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>In the world of today, business and industry are increasingly using computer applications and simulations to analyze industrial processes and components that improve process efficiency and safety and reduce operating cost. This Virtual Industrial Process Simulator Lab project at Augusta Technical College in Georgia is designed to enhance the education and instruction of engineering technology students utilizing 3D Virtual Simulation so that graduates of the programs can perform technical functions and assume greater responsibilities immediately upon hire. Utilizing this emerging technology to model industrial processes in a virtual instructional environment is unique to technical education. Students will thus have the technical knowledge and skills to be highly qualified and better prepared engineering technicians for industry and manufacturing as the computer based virtual simulation technology helps students to learn to adapt quickly to industrial process and equipment changes that meet the needs of industry. The inclusion of virtual simulation instruction in the engineering technology programs at Augusta Technical College will attract new students into technical programs and will be utilized in local outreach efforts with high school science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs to increase enrollment. The college has a long history of increasing diversity in engineering technology programs and will continue and expand that impact in this project. A comprehensive evaluation is being developed to research and evaluate the success of the project and its deliverables, as well as the sharing of best practices. Project results will be disseminated widely so that other engineering technology programs around the country can build on these efforts to graduate technicians with the skills required in the jobs of today and tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four objectives of the project are: (1) increasing and deepening the technical knowledge and skill level of engineering technology students through 3D Virtual Simulation instructional methods; (2) developing curriculum to utilize 3D simulations effectively; (3) providing professional development for engineering technology faculty so that they can incorporate Virtual Simulation into their courses; and (4) increasing the number of graduates who are better prepared for technical responsibilities and functioning as engineering technicians in industry. The project will be incorporated into the Mechanical Engineering Technology and Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology programs at the college that are accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET. Through collaborative efforts with industry partners, the engineering technology programs have obtained simulation software, 3D modeling, and technical computer support which has allowed the institution to implement a Virtual Simulation Pilot Lab (VSPL). Although many suppliers have developed 3D virtual simulation equipment models of industrial equipment, no single supplier has synchronized these models into a single Computer Aided Design (CAD) program formatted to replicate industrial processes and their components; so graduates must be familiar with a range of CAD technologies to allow them to function quickly and adapt as needed. The project will also provide comprehensive faculty professional development to prepare faculty to use instructional methods not found in other associate degree curriculums. Collaborative efforts with local industries and software suppliers will result in long term technical support, faculty training, and the provision for the latest technical advancements in software to facilitate the means to bring 3D modeling and simulation to the classroom. The college is one of only four colleges in Georgia to be a part of the NSF Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Equity Pipeline Project to increase diversity in the STEM workforce and has also been supported through Predominately Black Institutions (PBI) Program at the Department of Education to improve the educational outcomes of African American male students. This project builds on those initiatives to increase advanced STEM opportunities for a diverse group of graduates for technical positions.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Mineral dust constitutes a critical nexus between the geosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. One of the most abundant atmospheric aerosols by mass, mineral dust can influence numerous ecosystem processes through its effects on climate and biogeochemistry. Dust supplies essential limiting nutrients as well as toxic pollutants to ecosystems, with long-term implications for elemental cycling. This project will address the considerable uncertainties regarding dust influence on terrestrial ecosystem processes, including wet dust deposition, carbon uptake, and evapotranspiration. It will maximize financial and societal return from publicly available data, provide training for the next generation scientific workforce, and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This highly interdisciplinary project will develop the foundation for testing an integrative framework for conceptualizing dust events, dust sinks, and ecosystem interactions during a period of historic drought. It will: (1) characterize dust events during a period of widespread severe to exceptional drought; 2) analyze the chemical composition and quantify the magnitude of wet dust deposition; (3) quantify the influence of dust events on ecosystem light use efficiency, water use efficiency, and carbon sequestration. The project integrates research and education with students at all levels, including a concerted effort to recruit underrepresented students. The team will produce a lecture and laboratory module on drought and dust in arid and semi-arid regions. The project will contribute to the career development of one early career and one postdoctoral scholar (both female and Hispanic).</AbstractNarration>

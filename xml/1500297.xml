    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC). The 2015 edition will be held in Daejeon, South Korea, on July 6-10, 2015 (more info on the website http://fpsac.combinatorics.kr/). The 2016 edition will be held in Vancouver, Canada, on July 4-8, 2016 (more info on the website https://sites.google.com/site/fpsac2016/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the world, FPSAC offers young American researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely with top mathematicians from many countries. Somewhat interdisciplinary, the conferences link research in combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry, and to topics in other sciences such as computer science, physics, and biology. Each conference, which includes nine one-hour plenary lectures, thirty half-hour contributed talks, and forty posters, will attract over 200 participants from all over the world.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The field of indoor localization, mapping and navigation is rapidly developing and has the potential to change the way society interacts with its built surroundings. The proposed technology enables the precise localization of personnel and assets inside buildings where&lt;br/&gt;other technology (such as GPS) does not work. In heavy industrial settings (such as power plants, oil refineries, and chemical plants) the inability of knowing where workers and security personnel are located during routine operations, maintenance, and emergency situations leads to accidents and incidents that impact the safety and security of the facility. Adoption and integration of the proposed technology with other physical security infrastructure has the potential to decrease injuries and accidents and increase the effectiveness of plant operations and security. The localization technology enables highrisk workers (those that work in industrial settings and generally wear protective gear like hard-hats, safety glasses, hearing protection etc.) to have their location broadcast to an operations center. This is especially useful for alone workers, workers in confined spaces, or workers in areas that have restricted access due to either heavy equipment traffic or other safety issues (need for other protective clothing etc.). Areas within a facility can&lt;br/&gt;have geo-fences installed for individuals alerting them that they are in a high-risk area and in an emergency situation allow security or first-responder personnel to locate individuals quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps team's localization technology has been demonstrated in the lab and a lab-proto-type has been developed. The team is currently developing a field proto-type. The technology goals consist of building the field proto-type to be able to give demonstrations to interested parties and test the system in real-world applications. This team is developing key quantitative milestones on both the technology and business execution sides. Working with the team mentor, I-Corps instructors and I-Corps peers; this team is confident that it would identify a path to developing a pilot technology study with industry partners, identify first customers, the minimal viable product and clearly quantify the value proposition for its customers. The hope for the field proto-type is to clearly demonstrate the localization precision in different indoor environments.</AbstractNarration>

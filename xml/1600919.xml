    <AbstractNarration>Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support for junior faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who need to re-direct and re-build a research program. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the researcher's home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditionally, biophysics experimental techniques have been used to determine the structures of protein molecules. The goal of Tennessee State University's (TSU) HBCU-UP RIA project is to computationally predict the structure of proteins that are difficult to determine experimentally. The project's objectives are to 1) develop efficient algorithms to extract features from, process, and analyze the 3D cryo-EM images of protein macromolecules and 2) model protein macromolecules using their cryo-EM images. The educational goal of the project is to expose students to multidisciplinary research using a hands-on approach to prepare them to compete with their peers in industry or academia in various areas of bioinformatics. The educational approach and assessment will strongly support the curriculum modulation at Tennessee State University (TSU) and serve as a model for other HBCU institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the research has the potential for contributions to the fields of medicine and health.</AbstractNarration>

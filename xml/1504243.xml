    <AbstractNarration>The Computing Research Association's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W) will design, implement and evaluate a virtual research mentoring "town hall" model for large-scale mentoring of undergraduate women majors in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) towards research and graduate school. Women have been earning only 18% of the Bachelor's degrees in CSE from 2008-2012. These trends significantly limit the number of CSE women advancing into research and teaching careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will engage students in interactive meetings with distinguished female CSE researchers and students at virtually connected sites where local groups of women students are gathered. Distinguished researchers will present mini-lectures on their research and its impact, followed by an interactive question-and-answer town hall with mentoring related to research, graduate school, and topics suggested by students. This project will gather evidence to determine the efficacy of using virtual meetings to scale opportunities for access to role models, awareness of the research community, and mentoring to increase retention of undergraduate women in CSE. If effective, virtual "town hall" meetings have the potential to help to broaden participation in undergraduate research in CSE, will improve preparation for successful graduate school admissions and transitions, and will expand the local networks in computing communities across the country.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and implement "PolarTREC - Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating", a program that brings together U.S. teachers to participate in cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and often remote, locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. Through hands-on field experiences in the Arctic and Antarctica, participating teachers (pre-service and in-service) will improve teaching strategies, develop resources for their careers, and change how they teach STEM in the classroom. The program goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together in professional collaboration. By integrating research and education, PolarTREC will help sustain and grow the considerable academic and public enthusiasm for polar research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award provides funding for ARCUS to support 12 teacher-researcher teams during 2016. ARCUS will recruit, select, and match teachers and researchers, maintain a website for dissemination of information about the expeditions, provide orientation training for the teachers that includes field safety and communication training, provide travel support for the teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and for them to join the scientific expeditions in the field, and evaluate results of the program. Teachers will participate in a variety of outreach events following their deployments to ensure dissemination of information about the polar science and educational activities related to their scientific expeditions.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This award renews an exemplary Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site focusing on smart sensors and sensing systems at Michigan State University (MSU). The RET Site will continue to develop a strong partnership between MSU and schools in the greater Lansing-Detroit area to advance pre-college science and engineering education by training a cadre of leaders of middle and high school teachers in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The RET site will expose teachers to leading engineering research spanning biological and chemical sensors, robotics sensors, micro and nano-electro mechanical sensors, microelectronic sensing circuitry, human-computer interaction, biomechanics, innovative sensing materials and manufacturing techniques, and will connect them to the profound changes that sensors and sensing technologies are having on the daily lives and quality of life of all citizens. The interdisciplinary nature of the research theme will provide a fertile ground for developing creative and appealing middle and high school lessons and teaching activities in biology, physics, chemistry, and technology that align with state and national curricular standards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RET participants will attend a 6-week summer institute to participate in cutting-edge research projects with mentoring from engineering faculty who lead vibrant sensor and sensing related research programs. Working with principal investigators, faculty mentors, and a curriculum development specialist, teachers will develop innovative, standards-compliant curriculum modules and participate in a number of professional development activities. The teacher-created modules and lessons will be disseminated nationally through TeachEngineering.org, a nationally recognized repository for searchable, standards-based engineering curricula. Extensive follow-up activities are planned throughout the academic year to ensure the translation of lab experience into classroom practice, and to foster and strengthen long-term partnership between engineering faculty and the local school districts. A third-party professional program evaluator will track and evaluate the program and provide feedback for improvement. The evaluator will also conduct longitudinal studies on participants to assess the longer-term impact of the RET program.</AbstractNarration>

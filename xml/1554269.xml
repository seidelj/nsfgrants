    <AbstractNarration>This award will support the development of new analytical techniques to optimize the application of the newest generation electron microprobes on the market today. These instruments provide chemical composition data at scales less than one micrometer, which is crucial to unraveling the history of many earth science processes. This research and development project has significant potential impacts for providing guidance to utilization of these instruments for research being performed at the University of Wisconsin, in other NSF-funded facilities, and elsewhere around the world. The project will employ a postdoctoral research student for two years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Projects supported by this new instrument include many studies of deep-crustal processes: petrogenesis&lt;br/&gt;of magmatic systems, causes of explosive volcanic eruptions, conditions of granulite and of eclogite facies metamorphism, the genesis of economic deposits of metals and fossil fuels, tectonics of major shear zones, Hadean zircons, and meteoritics. Studies of near surface processes include: astrobiology, paleoclimatology (biogenic carbonates and foraminifera, speleothems), diagenesis and basin evolution, cementation in shallow fault zones, and nano-minerals.</AbstractNarration>

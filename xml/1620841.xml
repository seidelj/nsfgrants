    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of a select group of graduate students from US institutions at the International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2016) and the accompanying doctoral mentoring consortium (DMC) to be held in Singapore, May 9-13, 2016. AAMAS is the premier conference on multi-agent systems. There is an increasing interest in research on agents worldwide because of the many technologies where agents are applicable including: information retrieval, electronic commerce, robotics, and education tasks among many others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DMC will be held before the start of the main conference, enabling the students to participate fully in all aspects of both the conference and the consortium. The activities at the DMC will involve interactions at multiple levels, where: 1) students will present and discuss their work with their peers; 2) students will hone their ability to succinctly describe their research in a one minute elevator pitch; 3) student research will be shown at a poster session, open to any conference attendee; and 4) students will be paired with a mentor from the senior program committee, who will meet with them privately during the conference to provide feedback on their dissertation topics. The DMC usually features a selection of invited speakers and culminates with a career advice panel with researchers from academia, industry, and government. During the course of the conference, students will have the opportunities to maximize international interactions and make new professional connections.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>While women make up 51% of the nation's population and 59% of the workforce (US Census Bureau), they comprise a mere 30% of the technology industry. To keep the United States workforce competitive, particularly in the advanced technology industries, increasing the diversity of the workforce is crucial. STEMconnector® is a consortium of over 150 corporations, educational institutions, non-profit organizations and government entities concerned with STEM education and the future of human capital. With a particular emphasis on diversity and women, STEMconnector® targets stakeholders across the STEM spectrum who are passionate about educating and retaining the STEM workforce critical for driving the economy. STEMconnector® will host a workshop in September 2016 to facilitate the sharing of ideas surrounding broadening participation of women in ATE-related fields, especially entry-level technical jobs. This convening will bring together STEMconnector® members and members of the ATE community that actively work on increasing the diversity of the entry-level technical workforce. From the ATE Community, these include the Materials Science Education Support Center, the Regional Center for Next Generation Manufacturing and the National Institute for Women in Trade, Technology and Science (IWITTS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to a Gallup study, while 96 percent of Chief Academic Officers rate their institution as either very or somewhat effective at preparing students for the world of work, only 11 percent of business leaders strongly agree graduating students have the skills and competencies that their business needs. This workshop will provide an opportunity for stakeholders from various ATE industry sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture and IT, to directly communicate with the decision makers from ATE-focused colleges and universities. Not only will participating institutions have the platform to share their best practices for what is currently working, but they will also be able to collaborate to form new diversity strategies and build partnerships through connections made at the workshop. Through this workshop, STEMconnector® ultimately aspires to advance women in ATE entry-level jobs through increased recruitment and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The best practices shared and knowledge gained from this workshop will be widely disseminated through web access and print publications. The participating stakeholders will also share these ideas at their respective institutions by implementing action items to improve the diversity programs and strategies currently in place. The compiled resources will provide ATE and STEMconnector® members with tools to refine their outreach and retention strategies, and support women and other students with increased opportunities to succeed in entry-level advanced technology jobs. It is anticipated that the resources will also have the potential to impact women and other students who previously may not have thought of advanced technology industries as a viable career path.</AbstractNarration>

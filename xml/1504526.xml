    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to establish a new CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the Cal Poly Pomona (CPP) to prepare highly-qualified Cybersecurity professionals for entry into the federal, state, local, and tribal government workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cal Poly Pomona has been NSA/DHS Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense Education since 2005. The cybersecurity program for CyberCorps scholars at CPP distinguishes itself from other programs by its emphasis on interdisciplinary learning-by-doing approach through participation in the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) and National Cyber League (NCL) and research opportunities in contemporary cybersecurity topics such as smartphone security. The project will focus on the following major activities: (a) Student recruitment and academic mentoring to successfully place students in Federal jobs; (b) Hands-on training in various areas through the state-of-the-art cybersecurity laboratory, and by participating in the CCDC; (c) Promoting undergraduate research by having all SFS students participate in research-based capstone projects; (d) Professional development and certification training; (e) Interpersonal skill development in leadership, collaboration and communication skills of SFS scholarship recipients through their participation in the Air Force Association?s CyberPatriot activity with the Los Angeles Unified School District. The Cal Poly Pomona CyberCorps program will graduate professionals with hands-on training in cybersecurity as well as problem-solving skills to secure critical federal information infrastructure in innovative ways utilizing their experience in undergraduate research. The program scholars will develop community service skills through the outreach activities with K-12 students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will impact K-12 cybersecurity education and awareness by involving scholars in the CyberPatriot program. The scholars will also directly contribute to the community through their presentations at the Annual Cyber Security Fair. CPP is a Hispanic Serving Institution and ranks among the top 50 institutions granting degrees in science and engineering to Hispanic students. Many CPP SFS students will be first generation college, minority students, transferring from community colleges, and often from low-income backgrounds. Through academic mentoring to professional and interpersonal skills development, this SFS program will strive to train, place and retain them in federal Cybersecurity positions.</AbstractNarration>

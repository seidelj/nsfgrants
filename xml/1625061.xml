    <AbstractNarration>This project, acquiring High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources for data and compute-driven scientific discovery, aims to replace and extend outdated current equipment at the core of the institution's HPC infrastructure. Since the proposed configuration is designed to particularly address deficiencies of the current infrastructure and thus adapt it to the needs of its widening user base, acquiring this instrumentation should enhance current HPC facilities and enable transformational research over a broad front. Central, shared, on-campus HPC facilities reduce barriers to access computational resources, especially for junior scientists, students, and faculty from disciplines that are not traditional HPC users. This equipment complements existing and future investments and helps drive related faculty and undergraduate research and educational activities across the College of Science and Technology (CST) and the entire Temple community. With an enrollment around 38,000 graduate and undergraduate students, the institution boasts of a very diverse student body. With its large shared memory pool, the requested machine will be the first of its kind in the Greater Philadelphia region that has a high concentration of high-tech and IT-related industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will obtain 1. A large shared memory machine with 9TB addressable RAM, 2. An extensible, scalable parallel storage appliance with 1.5PB capacity, and 3 A 60-node conventional Linux cluster tuned for small to medium size parallel calculations. Computational science, materials science, biophysics, data analytics, and genomics are major themes running through the most active areas of CST research. Various centers and institutes reflect these themes, such as the 1. Institute for Genomics and Evolutionary Medicine, 2, Institute for Computational Molecular Science, 3.Center for Data Analytics and Biomedical Informatics, 4. Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology, and 5. Center for Computational Design of Functional Layered Materials. CST's, in tandem with the Colleges of Engineering and Liberal Arts, the Schools of Business and Pharmacy, the Fox Chase Cancer Center, and the School of Medicine aim to broadly impact research in big data, nano-scale science, imaging, neuroscience, as well as energy and health.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This project will support attendance by early-career scientists at the Keystone Symposia on Plant Epigenetics: From Genotype to Phenotype, to be held in Taos, NM on February 15-19, 2016. The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of Plant Epigenetics and the emphasis on understanding genotype to phenotype relationships continues to promise new and insightful mechanistic discoveries. This conference will provide a forum to discuss new discoveries, as well as the role of epigenetics in crop improvement and the potential for using epigenetic approaches for increasing crop productivity in the face of variable climate and environmental stresses. In addition, the meeting will provide opportunities to share updates on novel methodologies and methods for analysis that help address the need for new bioinformatics methods and infrastructure for sharing results. A primary goal of the conference is to grow the community of researchers studying or using plant epigenetics, especially those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

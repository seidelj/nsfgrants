    <AbstractNarration>Since 2010, Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University have hosted 15 mini-conferences of the Atlanta Lecture Series in Graph Theory and Combinatorics. This award provides support to continue this series for the academic year 2015/2016, with two more conferences in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016. These will be held at Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University, respectively. Each conference will feature two one-hour lectures by one distinguished researcher, four one-hour lectures by established researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four 30-minute talks by junior researchers and graduate students. The website is at http://www.math.gsu.edu/~gchen/ALS17/ALS17.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics and graph theory have undergone dramatic development in the past few decades. For the previous 15 meetings, the featured speakers were leading experts in the following areas of combinaroics and graph theory: structural graph theory, extremal graph theory, random graphs and graph percolations, hypergraphs and set theory, and the Szemeredi regularity lemma. The speaker pool not only has a good gender balance but also consists of a nice blend of senior, well-known researchers and young rising stars. The series has become a major event for the combinatorics community in the southeast region and beyond, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutions within the southeast region of the United States. These two mini-conferences will be a continuation of the series.</AbstractNarration>

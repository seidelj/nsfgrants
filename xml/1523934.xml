    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Jennifer Hodge is "Evolution of color pattern: function and rates of diversification." The host institution for this fellowship is the University of California, Davis, and the sponsoring scientist is Prof. Peter Wainwright. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coral reefs afford an rich environment in which to study biodiversity and the mechanism and rate of adaptive change and evolution as coral reef organisms experience environmental change. Coral reefs are endangered in many locations around the world and better knowledge of their biology and ecology informs conservation efforts. The fellowship research uses biological collections from the California Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian, as well as open-access collections of digital photographs and geographic range maps to determine how color pattern has evolved in coral reef butterflyfishes and the primary ecological functions color patterns may serve. Biological collections provide the opportunity to obtain fine-scale measurements of the color patterns of the fish for use in mathematical models to describe the variety of color patterns observed in butterflyfishes. Results promise to explain how color patterns in butterflyfish have evolved adaptively in relation to ecological niche and to what extent color pattern is important in species recognition and mate selection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training goals include applying functional morphology as an indicator of ecological niche, mathematical modeling to simulate biological patterns, and comparative phylogenetic analyses to test predictions about trait correlation and rates of trait evolution. Educational outreach includes mentoring undergraduate students participating in the Ecology and Evolution Graduate Admissions Pathways program. Educational outreach activities also include guest lectures and engagement with the community at public science exhibits.</AbstractNarration>

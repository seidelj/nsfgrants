    <AbstractNarration>The transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next is important in maintaining cultural practices as well as community resources. Understanding the reasons for losing this knowledge is fundamental to explaining how cultures maintain practices and beliefs over generations. The research supported by this award focuses on understanding the transmission of traditional cultural knowledge about the role of land and its use. This research will investigate the barriers to the communication of this knowledge as well as seeking to understand how changes in language and decreasing access to and availability of resources represent substantial social and environmental challenges facing the Cherokee people. How will the Cherokee people address these challenges and develop strategies for cultural revitalization and modify traditional practices of communicating cultural knowledge. To answer these questions, anthropologist Dr. Clint R. Carroll of the University of Colorado-Boulder will investigate how Native American people mentally and physically navigate barriers to their land-based cultural knowledge and practices, how such approaches to social and environmental challenges may inform the broader society, and whether tribal environmental education in traditional and standard science can contribute to local cultural and ecological resiliency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be carried out in five Oklahoma counties where Cherokees are the largest minority. The project has three phases. First, the PI will collaborate with the tribal biologist and a Cherokee group dedicated to the preservation of traditional ecological knowledge to devise modules for a special 3-year program focused on teaching the following: Western and Cherokee knowledge of regional plants, animals, and ecological processes; social science research methods, including ethnographic interviewing, participatory mapping, and GIS; Cherokee language; and traditional Cherokee medicine. The PI and his collaborators will then competitively select students to complete the program and gather data. The researcher and the students will survey rural households, conduct in-depth ethnographic interviews, and carry out participatory mapping to locate resource areas, record knowledge about those areas, and determine barriers to assessing them. The project will conclude with an assessment of the educational program, finalizing the resource maps, and analyzing the data to pinpoint the linkages between resource access, knowledge preservation, language revitalization, and land conservation. Findings from the research will document and contribute to social science theory of cultural resilience and adaptation to the environmental shifts and changing resource access accompanying climate change. Broader Impacts include training a future generation of Cherokee scientists, supporting tribal efforts to maintain language and traditional ecological knowledge, and documenting resources and language. All materials produced will be housed with the Cherokee Nation, in Oklahoma archives, and at the University of Colorado.</AbstractNarration>

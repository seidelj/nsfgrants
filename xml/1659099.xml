    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Advanced Materials at Rutgers Engineering. The objective of the NSF-REU activity is to provide unique opportunities for a diverse population of undergraduate students to conduct cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research in the field of Advanced Materials. The program features high-quality interaction of students with faculty/mentor and access to professional development opportunities through research. The program has basic elements of research training and professional developments to enhance learning. Diverse groups of students, including underrepresented group of students, are recruited for this program, who might not otherwise have the opportunity. A large fraction of the student participants are recruited from academic institutions where research opportunities are limited, including two-year colleges. The impact of this program is to encourage undergraduates to continue their studies and develop their abilities as professionals, which can last for years to come.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical goal is development of novel advanced materials of structural levels ranging from nano-scale to macro-scale, both theoretical and experimental. The advanced materials developed are anticancer nanomaterials, organic light emitting devices, hybrid materials, inorganic polymers, and advanced polymer/ceramic composites by using novel and creative approaches. It is highly desirable that students are exposed to advanced materials through the cutting-edge research. The research exploration learned in this REU Site, as opposed to learning from textbooks, is a long lasting and rewarding influence on participating students.</AbstractNarration>

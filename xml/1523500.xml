    <AbstractNarration>This research is focused on the study of secondary organic aerosol (SOA), very small particles condensed from the gas phase, in environmental chambers and the effects of gas and particle deposition onto the chamber walls. Modeling studies generally utilize fundamental data from environmental chambers in predicting ambient aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere. Currently a discrepancy exists between model predictions and atmospheric measurements of SOA. The reanalysis of historical chamber experiments indicates that prior reported SOA yields may have been underpredicted. The information from this research is critical for understanding aerosol-induced health effects and contributions to global aerosol radiative forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work includes: (1) Measurements of the wall deposition rates of individual organic species on the Teflon walls of a chamber and correlation of those rates to molecular properties of the species; (2) Chamber experiments with a wide range of important biogenic and anthropogenic volatile organic compounds in which the competition between vapor transport to particles and the walls is modulated; and (3) Development of a comprehensive model of chamber vapor dynamics that allows quantitative assessment from data on individual species of the impact of vapor wall deposition and extrapolation to atmospheric "wall-less" conditions.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The United States is rapidly losing coastal wetlands, critical ecosystems that nourish fisheries, clean our water and protect us from storms. While some marsh losses result from coastal development, others losses have yet to be fully explained. Marshes can build soil vertically and gain elevation to keep pace with slowly rising seas, but the marsh plants that sustain these ecosystems get stressed when sea level rises too quickly. The amount of sea level a marsh can tolerate depends on other factors that are also changing. For instance, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising. Likewise, pollution from nutrients like nitrogen has increased sharply from preindustrial times. Both increased carbon dioxide and nitrogen tend to make marsh plants grow more, which could help marshes keep up with sea level rise. But they also change the types of plants that grow and it is unknown what effects that will have on marshes. This project asks: how will rising carbon dioxide and nitrogen affect plants and the ability of coastal marshes to keep up with sea level rise? Since about half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a coastline, there is considerable pressure on coastal wetlands and the services they provide. The annual loss of low-lying coastal wetlands lost to open water each year threatens fisheries, wildlife habitat, water quality, and infrastructure. The project will also continue public education and science education programs at many levels, and the research results will be made freely available on a public Smithsonian Institution website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the central question of this project, the study builds on a thirty-year history of ecological observations at a Chesapeake Bay marsh in Maryland. Measurements of primary production and soil chemistry will be combined with parallel experiments that simulate the future environment by adding carbon dioxide and nitrogen to marsh plots, and comparisons will be made of native to invading plants. The long-term records of this site enable the scientists to document changes in the species composition of plants growing on the marsh over time. At this point, the surface elevation of the soil in the marsh is falling behind local sea level rise, suggesting that this marsh may be in the process of collapsing. The investigators will continue their local measurements, but the results should be generally applicable to coastal wetlands everywhere.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at St. Philip's College (SPC), a minority-serving institution designated as both a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), seeks to recruit, retain and provide math acceleration for first time in college (FTIC) students. SPC's students face many challenges to post-secondary educational success and unfortunately, only a small percentage of students enroll and succeed in STEM courses. The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Enrichment by Design (STEMed) project will address the need for low entry students to improve their pathway to a successful STEM education. This project will allow students to move into college-level mathematics courses sooner than usual, therefore graduating earlier. This reduction in obstacles will increase the number of students graduating from SPC, transferring to a 4 year institution and continuing their STEM education, and/or entering the workforce. While SPC improves its developmental math and STEM programs, STEM students from diverse backgrounds will increasingly obtain a quality education. The local community and the nation will benefit from the increase in these future STEM professionals in the workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the STEMed project is to decrease the time FTIC students take to complete their STEM degree and graduate by focusing on recruiting, retaining, and accelerating FTIC STEM students through developmental math. This goal will be accomplished through the following specific objectives: 1) recruit FTIC STEM students from San Antonio Independent School District and SPC's Veteran's Office; 2) implement the Accelerated Math Preparation (AMP) Program to help FTIC STEM students advance into college level math; (3) provide Student Incentive Stipends (SIS) for those in financial need who complete the program; and 4) mentor students until graduation and/or transfer to a four-year institution. The expected outcomes are to decrease degree completion time and increase the number of STEM degree graduates.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will provide a forum for constructive dialogue between publishing professionals and members of various stakeholder communities with a shared interest in public dissemination of scholarly research in engineering and the information sciences, as represented by a variety of IEEE societies including, Signal Processing, Control Systems, Robotics and Automation, Information Theory, and Circuits and Systems. Participants will explore three interrelated and increasingly important questions concerning future approaches to deriving the maximum possible benefit from the products of engineering research:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the essential products of scholarly engineering research, how will these be likely to change in the future?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. What are economically sustainable approaches to providing public access to engineering research products?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. As nontraditional types of research products (e.g. data and software) become a significant component of the curated engineering research record, how should quality assurance be organized and paid for?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of ensuring that future engineering research will be maximally reproducible underlies all these questions. Workshop presentations by publishing professionals will explore current and planned approaches to data and software curation in engineering and other disciplines. There will also be presentations by data professionals who currently provide platforms for such curation as well as those engaged in research on fundamental data science, data infrastructure, and cyber-infrastructure. Using new curation and publishing technologies to most effectively harvest value from curated research products will be explored in alignment with stated National Science Foundation objectives of developing new advances in data infrastructure and analytics, reproducibility, privacy and protection, and research in the human-data interface. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics to be covered by the workshop include,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Data curation -ethical data management&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Software curation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Versioning of archival literature&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Research reproducibility -including reproducibility metrics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Peer review -data, software, versions - how to manage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- The evolving relationship between scholarly publishers, researchers, and research libraries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will include researchers, representatives of selected publishers, data curation professionals, engineering researchers, and public access representatives from the U.S. National Science Foundation and other U.S. Government research agencies. The preliminary date and venue of the workshop are November 5,6, 2016 in the Washington DC area.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The meeting "Partnerships: Workshop on Non-profit/NSF Collaborations" will take place at the National Science Foundation on May 28-29, 2015. The National Science Foundation (NSF) and non-profit organizations each provide critical support to the U.S. basic research enterprise in the mathematical and physical sciences. While the missions of these funders differ, many of their goals align and the grantee communities have significant overlap. In recent years, efforts of private organizations have played a more and more significant part of the whole picture of the funding of science. There are great opportunities: private support can be very flexible and allow discovery-driven investigation beyond what public funding can tolerate. This workshop will explore the ways in which the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the NSF and private foundations can form useful partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will examine partnerships between the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) at NSF and non-profit funders in MPS-related disciplines to &lt;br/&gt;- understand different models of collaboration (the "how"); &lt;br/&gt;- understand different motivations for collaboration (the "why"); and &lt;br/&gt;- develop opportunities for future communication and/or collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;After examining partnerships of various types, participants will discuss creative opportunities for future coordination. Discussions will entail both scientific focus and logistical considerations. The central events of the workshop will be a series of case studies, and a series of small-group discussions with reports back to the workshop as a whole. A technical writer will take notes and synthesize take-away themes for a report that will be made widely available.</AbstractNarration>

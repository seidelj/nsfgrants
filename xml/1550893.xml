    <AbstractNarration>The digital revolution has created new opportunities in the management and use of all types of research (and other) data and information. Most areas of scientific research are now data-driven and this has produced a broad range of quantitative and qualitative improvements in the research enterprise. The communication of research results in myriad forms, both formal and informal, has also increased and improved. The day-to-day practices of the established fields of science and engineering are changing in response to the emergence of new computer- and network-based modes of communication and collaboration. These issues need to be understood by the various stakeholders in our nation's research enterprise, including the research communities in government, academia, and industry, research policymakers and managers in the Administration and Congress, and ultimately the public that both supports these activities and benefits from improved effectiveness. Acting through the NRC, the U.S. CODATA provides an interdisciplinary mechanism and focal point for bringing greater understanding and visibility to these issues, for adding value to the sponsors' objectives and priorities in these areas, and for helping to improve returns on the public investments of federal agencies. U.S. CODATA will hold one two-day meeting. The principal focus of this meeting will be to review the progress of activities already underway and those being planned under its auspices, and to discuss with the U.S. CODATA's sponsors and external experts the key issues that may need some action or follow-up. The U.S. CODATA staff will disseminate online and other information related to the U.S. CODATA activities and outputs. Toward this end, the U.S. CODATA has developed an Outreach and Communication strategy.</AbstractNarration>

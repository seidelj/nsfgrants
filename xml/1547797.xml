    <AbstractNarration>This project will support NSF-funded investigators to participate in the upcoming NASA-funded ATom (Atmospheric Tomography Mission) project. The objective of ATom is to map the global atmospheric distribution of particles, reactive gases, and short-lived species relevant for understanding climate. Two instrument packages will be added to the first of four deployments of the NASA DC-8 aircraft scheduled for June-August 2016. These instruments will provide data critical for advancing fundamental aspects of carbon and climate science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The two instrument packages to be deployed are the NCAR Airborne Oxygen Instrument (AO2), which provides rapid in situ measurements of atmospheric O2 and CO2 concentrations, and the NCAR/Scripps Medusa flask sampler, which collects samples for analysis of O2/N2, CO2 concentration, CO2 isotopes and Ar/N2. Both of these instruments are mature and have been used extensively, including on the 5 NSF-supported HIPPO campaigns from 2009-2011. By combining these measurements with large-scale atmospheric transport models, direct constraints on the corresponding air-sea fluxes of heat, O2, and CO2 are obtained. This research will advance a broader range of issues related to the carbon cycle and climate, such as the distribution of carbon sinks and the links between ocean biochemistry, carbon cycling, and climate change.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Marquette University proposes a the PUMP-CS project, (Preparing Urban Milwaukee for Principles of Computer Science,) which will provide access to the AP CS Principles (CSP) course at all Milwaukee high schools by 2020. At a time of unprecedented interest in computer science (CS) in K-12, Wisconsin sees an increasing stratification of access to CS. High-resourced schools, with CS curricula in place, are rapidly expanding offerings to match enrollment. Under-resourced schools have zero CS, or are seeing meager access diminished as scarce, qualified CS teachers are drained away to the suburbs. Less than 7% of Wisconsin's 500+ public high schools offer AP CS courses, and none of the 30 high schools in their largest urban district have any AP CS courses. Only two of the state's twenty largest college campuses have a CS teacher education program. If this stratification continues in the coming decade, an unprecedented number of Wisconsin high school students -- a disproportionate number of them from underrepresented groups -- will have no access to CS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2014, this team launched a three-year CS10K project that aimed to introduce Exploring Computer Science (ECS) in high schools across the state. To date, 26 school districts have added ECS, including 7 of the largest schools in Milwaukee. Over 1,300 students have had access to ECS in the last three terms, most having no prior CS options. The PUMP-CS Project aims to extend that work by creating a multi-track professional development (PD) sequence for endorsing teachers--regardless of prior CS-specific knowledge--to teach either ECS or AP CSP. The first track prepares in-service teachers to lead ECS, integrating an inquiry- and equity-based pedagogy to convey solid CS content while appealing to a more diverse student population than traditional CS offerings. The second track enables in-service teachers to add a CS-specific endorsement to their primary certification, while continuing to promote pedagogical reform. A third track provides supporting professional development for middle school teachers, elementary school teachers, and after school program facilitators.</AbstractNarration>

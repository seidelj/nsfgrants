    <AbstractNarration>Part 1:&lt;br/&gt;The health of our nation's economy depends on the continued growth of a STEM workforce. The effective application of high performance computing (HPC) is a skill increasingly demanded in a widening variety of fields including engineering, biology, plant science, biochemistry, and many others. This REU program will equip underrepresented students to pursue STEM careers by training them to use HPC in mathematics and statistics, engineering, and biological sciences. Participating undergraduate students will engage in cutting-edge research to learn how high fidelity models represent physical phenomena; how these models are implemented within HPC; and how results are analyzed, interpreted, and used to resolve theoretical and applied problems. In addition, a variety of personal, interpersonal, and leadership skills (including technical communication, time management, networking, and continuous improvement) will be cultivated through complementary hands-on/minds-on activities. This project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science by engaging undergraduate students in state-of-the art research in engineering applications and computation; and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by strengthening the STEM workforce and increasing the participation of underrepresented groups and veterans returning from active duty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part 2:&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this REU program are to enhance student capacity to: 1) conduct innovative and meaningful research using HPC, 2) learn and think independently within an interdisciplinary collaborative environment, 3) conduct research with the utmost integrity, 4) prepare for professional careers, and 5) pursue graduate degrees in STEM programs. This program will recruit ten students per year from a diverse pool of first- and second-year students from smaller colleges, tribal colleges, and community colleges, with an emphasis on both minority and traditionally underrepresented students, as well as returning veterans. These students will participate in an intensive ten-week summer program and will work closely with faculty mentors on research projects that involve 1) simulation tools in the context of engineering design and analysis; 2) state-of-the-art research tools in engineering applications and computation; 3) statistical analysis based on real datasets and simulations; and 4) advanced numerical methods including parallel algorithms in HPC. The tangible outcomes will include student-authored journal articles, conference proceedings, and technical presentations. Program success will be assessed by an external evaluator through formative and summative evaluations, daily student reflections, student interviews, and student enrollment in STEM graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

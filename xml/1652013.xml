    <AbstractNarration>All species share many genes in common with other organisms, but each species has a handful of new genes that came into existence only recently and are thus either unique to that species or shared only with its closest relatives. In a variety of animal and plant species, many such newly evolved genes are thought to impact the male reproductive system. The goal of this project is to determine how newly evolved genes influence male reproductive success by focusing on those that affect sperm function in the fruit fly model system, Drosophila melanogaster. This research will generate important basic science knowledge about how new genes change reproductive systems to the benefit of their carriers. Its broader implications relate to the potential development of strategies that inhibit the reproduction of insect species that are agricultural pests or that transmit human diseases, such as the mosquitoes that carry malaria and the Zika virus. By establishing the importance of lineage-specific genes for male reproduction, this research may aid in the development of smart pesticides, or genetic manipulation strategies that target genes found only in the problematic insect species and not other beneficial insects in the surrounding environment. This project will also benefit society by increasing the participation of undergraduates in original research and supporting innovative mentoring programs that encourage the persistence of students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. The research will be conducted at an exclusively undergraduate institution and will be carried out, in part, by students in an intermediate-level Genetics course and students conducting independent research in a faculty member's lab. The project will also support a program in which first-year college students from underrepresented groups join research labs immediately upon their arrival on campus, providing these students with a sense of community and introducing them to scientific research as they begin college. Finally, the project will support a student-run organization that pairs college students with girls from underserved public high schools for weekly mentoring sessions that include assistance with math and science skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses specifically on so-called "de novo" genes that have recently evolved from non-coding DNA sequence. Previous research from a variety of taxa has focused on identifying these genes and studying their emergence within populations, but little is known about their specific molecular and cellular functions. Working in the safe and genetically tractable Drosophila melanogaster model system, this project will begin by using RNA interference to screen all de novo genes expressed in the testes for effects on male fertility. Genes whose expression is required for full fertility will become targets for functional characterization, which will be facilitated by the development of tagged transgenes, antibodies, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout mutant lines. These tools will be used in cytological experiments to investigate how each gene influences the process of spermatogenesis and/or the function of mature sperm after they are transferred to females. In parallel with these functional genetic analyses, the evolutionary history of each gene will be examined across related Drosophila species in order to understand how the gene arose from non-coding DNA sequence and how the protein it encodes has evolved since its emergence. For de novo genes that show signatures of rapid divergence between species, further genetic experiments will be conducted to determine the functional consequences of divergence. Taken together, these experiments will provide a comprehensive view of how the process of new gene creation can modify reproductive phenotypes.</AbstractNarration>

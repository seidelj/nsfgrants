    <AbstractNarration>The REU Site in Discrete and Applied Mathematics is an eight week summer research experience for undergraduate students. The program stimulates interest in the mathematical sciences through research on accessible and open research problems. This program targets students at an earlier stage of their undergraduate studies and provides a research opportunity for those students who might otherwise have decided against a career in the mathematical sciences before ever learning about the exciting opportunities and challenges present in mathematics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, nine promising undergraduates are selected to participate. Students learn to read research articles; to formulate conjectures and construct examples; to program simulations; to concentrate, listen, and ask questions; to generalize and simplify proofs; and to disseminate their discoveries. Students are immersed in an environment where the mathematical ideas are new and not fully understood. Students work in one of three separate research groups. Students present their progress on a weekly basis. Students present at regional and national conferences on undergraduate research. Students write a research article suitable for submission to an appropriate mathematics or science journal. Students' discoveries contribute to many fields of mathematics research: computational biology and modeling, combinatorial games, combinatorial knot theory, recursive polynomials, analysis of large data sets in biology, and others.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Florida's Whitney Laboratory for Marine Bioscience in St. Augustine, FL will provide research training for 8 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016-2020. The program provides undergraduates with a realistic research experience that will inspire student interest in science and motivate their consideration of a basic research career. Through individualized interactions with mentors, students perform full-time lab or field research. Increased independence over the course of the program is emphasized. Research projects typically use marine models to enhance student understanding of basic mechanisms in biology in the context of evolution and species biodiversity. Guided field trips to local marine estuaries, inland fresh water springs, and the Gulf coast introduce varied ecosystems. Weekly research seminars and workshops provide training on the responsible conduct of research, professional communication skills, science literacy, and diverse career paths in science related fields. Students meet with graduate coordinators at the University of Florida to learn the graduate school application process. Students are recruited nationwide through digital and flyer-based advertising, at conferences, and trips to institutions. Students are selected based on academic record and research potential. Special attention is given to applicants from groups currently underrepresented in the sciences and groups for whom evidence suggests the REU experience has the greatest impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 40 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences and pursue advanced STEM training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are tracked after the program to determine their continued interest in science and their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http:// http://www.whitney.ufl.edu/academic/undergrad-reu/.

    <AbstractNarration>The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a global array of radio telescopes operating in unison to undertake 1mm wavelength Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging of the black holes in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy and the core of the radio galaxy M87. The EHT may potentially be able to image the close environs of these black holes, near the event horizon, the region where the gravitational pull of the black hole is so powerful that not even light can escape. This conference brings together the growing community of researchers interested in this topic. Funding via this award will support other investments NSF is making in this area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student training, outreach, and integrating junior researchers into the collaboration are important for STEM training in general and for building the EHT community. Supporting the travel of students and junior researchers to the 2014 collaboration conference is the top priority of this award. The proceedings of the workshop will be linked on the EHT2014 website after the meeting concludes. In addition to slides and abstracts, audio and video recordings of talks will be included. There will also be a public lecture by the PI during the conference.</AbstractNarration>

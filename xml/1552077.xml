    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on increasing the understanding of how human-produced emissions combine with biogenic emissions from forests to influence the formation of small particles in the atmosphere. A mobile laboratory will be deployed to two different types of forests (urban and remote) in order to compare and contrast the impact of long-range and short-range transport of nitrogen species to forests. The results will lead to improved control strategies that minimize the health, visibility and climate effects of anthropogenic emissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the science campaign are to: (1) Characterize the ambient aerosol, radiation, and trace gases at two forest sites, both above and below the canopy, and along a north-south transect in the central United States; (2) Quantify the level of oxidation found in SOA using atomic ratios (such as the oxygen to carbon ratio, O:C) and determine the impact the presence of particulate organic nitrate (PON) has on the observed oxidation state of the submicron particulate matter (PM); (3) Investigate how in-canopy gradients and through-canopy transport impact submicron PM, PON, and oxidants; (4) Determine the impact nitrogen oxides (NOx) have on volatile organic carbon (VOC) oxidation and SOA formation in all locations; (5) Compare and contrast the chemistry of remote, on-road, and urban forested areas; (6) Identify the factors contributing to SOA using positive matrix factorization (PMF) to identify important components of SOA under different levels of anthropogenic influence both above and below canopy; and (7) Investigate the fate of NOx in all locations.</AbstractNarration>

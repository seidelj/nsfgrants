    <AbstractNarration>We propose a project to increase understanding of the economic value of natural language communication both theoretically and empirically. Language is a powerful and complex human tool facilitating social and economic decisions. The richly detailed structure of natural language has evidently survived an evolutionary process has led some economists to argue for its importance not only to understanding grammar but also for understanding human social and economic decisions. Consequently, it has been long argued that the existence of a rich language should play a more prominent role in game theory (see Farrell, 1993). At the same time, others have demonstrated empirically that, in in contrast to situations where players can engage in limited forms of communication, efficient economic outcomes emerge more readily when players can communicate using rich natural language. Our aim here is to present and test a formal framework that predicts people both use and respond to multi-meaning natural language in a way that improves coordination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates why cheap-talk natural language communication is systematically found to promote coordination better than predetermined intention signaling. We hypothesize the reason is that, when communicating with natural language, people both use and respond to intentions and attitudes, where attitude indicates the strength of a message sender's desire to have her message followed. We test our hypothesis using controlled laboratory experiments in both the United States and China. Our preliminary data has shown (i) free-form messages do include both signaled intentions and attitudes; (ii) people respond both to intentions and attitudes when making decisions; and (iii) the use of attitude significantly improves coordination. Moreover, while males and females recognize and respond to intentions and attitude equally well, we find females are more likely to send more demanding signals than males, while males send messages focused more on the equilibrium outcome than attitude. Overall, we find that natural language communication in our environment can be well-modeled by a language that includes both intentions and attitudes. We propose to conduct more experiments to assess whether these results are robust with a variety of games and within the context of social learning environments. In particular, building on a well-established literature, we propose to test the hypothesis that natural language brings unique value beyond that which is available from knowledge of social history or narrowly constructed advice. Our research helps to identify the features of natural language communication that promote coordination, and also sheds light on the nature of communication systems that may promote efficient economic outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>With this award supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF), and EPSCoR programs, Professor Brenton DeBoef from University of Rhode Island and colleagues William Euler, Jimmie Oxley, Brett Lucht and Geoffrey Bothun will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students. Additional broader impacts of the proposed instrument will be realized by the hands-on training of advanced chemistry students in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation, the continued growth of chemistry-related research and education at URI, and the outreach between URI Chemistry and its community, including the hosting of an annual, state-wide High School Chemistry contest, and an annual Chemistry Camp for junior high girls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) understanding regioselective oxidative cross-coupling via C?H activation; (b) studying cryptophane-derived molecular probes for hyperpolarized Xenon-129 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (c) discovering new and sensitive methods for the detection of explosives using fluorescence spectroscopy; (d) developing a better understanding of reactions in lithium batteries; (e) investigating organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization (ROP) processes; (f) studying Clostridium pasteurianum adaptation during crude glycerol fermentation; (g) investigating interactions between engineered nanoparticles and biological membranes; and (h) synthesizing organic macrocycles.</AbstractNarration>

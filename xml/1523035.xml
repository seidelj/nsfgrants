    <AbstractNarration>The recipients will organize a two-day workshop to bring together principal investigators, senior personnel, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from 2013 and 2014 Coastal SEES cohorts to interact and exchange ideas with each other and external experts. The intention of the workshop overall is to provide a venue to exchanging information and ideas regarding current Coastal&lt;br/&gt;SEES projects, as well as discuss and identify new collaborations for future work, enhance interdisciplinary collaboration in coastal sustainability research, and identify gaps and challenges for addressing coastal sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal SEES projects are especially complex in that each project involves typically multiple science disciplines and/or engineering, as well as some component that focuses on the human dimension of the sustainability problem. In addition, most projects identify a pathway through which scientific progress can be translated to practical outcomes, such as more informed decision making. The need for a principal investigators meeting to exchange ideas and best practices for dealing with this complexity was anticipated in the program solicitation, which instructed the investigators to plan to attend such a meeting. This award covers very modest costs for the organization and logistics of the meeting.</AbstractNarration>

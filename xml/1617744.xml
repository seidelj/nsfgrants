    <AbstractNarration>A key challenge in many autonomous robot manipulation applications is&lt;br/&gt;the rearrangement of multiple objects. There are two situations where&lt;br/&gt;such needs arise: (i) the manipulation task itself is to rearrange&lt;br/&gt;objects, and (ii) occluding items must be rearranged to allow the&lt;br/&gt;robot access to the target object(s). Examples of such scenarios can&lt;br/&gt;arise in warehouses and industrial setups, where a robot has to&lt;br/&gt;frequently select, pick and transfer products, packages and pallets in&lt;br/&gt;the presence of many other similar objects. Another example comes from&lt;br/&gt;service robotics, where a robotic assistant that operates in a human&lt;br/&gt;space has to frequently retrieve or rearrange multiple items placed in&lt;br/&gt;narrow spaces, such as objects in shelves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates which classes of multi-object manipulation&lt;br/&gt;planning can be efficiently addressed given progress in multi-body&lt;br/&gt;motion planning and develops a powerful suite of novel computational&lt;br/&gt;solutions. The key insight is that for many real-world rearrangement&lt;br/&gt;tasks the sequence of object motions to solve the problem, ignoring&lt;br/&gt;grasping aspects, look similar to solutions of multi-body motion&lt;br/&gt;planning, especially for similar sized objects. The study of this link&lt;br/&gt;reveals it is possible to cast certain multi-object manipulation&lt;br/&gt;problems as a "pebble motion problem on a graph", which is well&lt;br/&gt;studied in algorithmic theory and multi-body motion planning. The&lt;br/&gt;overall objective is to provide rigorous methods with desirable&lt;br/&gt;completeness and optimality guarantees for multi-object manipulation,&lt;br/&gt;which exhibit good scalability and efficiency for problems where&lt;br/&gt;current methods face issues with the inherent combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;complexity. Such methods could also be used as guiding heuristics for&lt;br/&gt;tasks with additional constraints, such as non-trivial dynamics and&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty.</AbstractNarration>

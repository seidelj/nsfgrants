    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the acquisition of a new generation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). This instrumentation would replace the aging MC-ICP-MS currently used by the Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas, Austin. Acquisition of a new MC-ICP-MS will expand the research directions and capabilities offered by the Jackson School of Geosciences and enrich educational opportunities for students. JSG faculty are engaged in a variety of outreach activities, and research involving the new instrument will be integrated into an ongoing REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program, GK-12 outreach program partnering K-12 teachers and STEM graduate students, and GeoFORCE (a successful college preparatory outreach program targeting Texas minority high school students).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous scientists at UT-Austin have both current and planned research projects requiring a new generation MC-ICP-MS analyses. These analytical needs include the development of new techniques in addition to applying existing methodologies to answer new and innovative research questions. These include U-series measurements to determine ages on carbonates. This will be applied to a variety of research topics including studies of cave, pedogenic and lacustrine carbonate deposits and dating of ostrich egg shells to investigate the timing of human evolution. A modern MC-ICP-MS would also facilitate the concurrent measurement of Hf and Pb isotopes and allow us to identify both the isotopic fingerprint and age within a single growth zone in zircons, crucial to investigations of magma chamber evolution and sediment provenance. Additional research applications include high spatial resolution in situ Sr isotope measurements in a) biogenic carbonates in fishes to reconstruct migration histories, b) speleothems in karst hydrologic systems to reconstruct drip-water evolution and climate, and c) feldspar phenocrysts to track magma mixing and crustal assimilation. The new instrument will also be used to measure a variety of isotopes including Li, Os, and Pb for isotopic fingerprinting of mineral phases and bulk rocks and Fe and Zn isotopes to investigate metal uptake in cells.</AbstractNarration>

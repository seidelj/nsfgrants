    <AbstractNarration>This project will support strategic planning by the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL). RMBL is a private, non-profit research institution that has hosted 142 scientists in the last five years. Funding will allow Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory's Planning Committee, consisting of four board members and the Executive Director, to visit larger, independent research institutions to explore how other research institutions manage operational revenue streams, fundraising, government contracts, marketing, branding, and endowment. The committee will also explore how organizations use metrics to track institutional effectiveness. The committee will provide a report to RMBL's Board as part of setting priorities for RMBL's strategic planning and developing a financial plan for RMBL that increases our ability to support research and research training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of creating RMBL's next strategic plan, a planning committee will visit a number of other independent research institutions to better understand their funding models, examining fundraising, branding/marketing, operational revenue streams, and branding and marketing. Additionally, we will father information on how these institutions use metrics to track performance. A written summary of the findings will be made through the Organization of Biological Field Stations so that other similar institutions will have access to the information.

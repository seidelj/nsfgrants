    <AbstractNarration>The award will support a workshop on "Enabling Composable and Modular Manufacturing through Abstractions," which will be held in the San Francisco Bay area in the fall of 2015. The purpose of the workshop is to identify research opportunities and priorities at the intersection of computing and manufacturing. The workshop will engage research leaders in the computing community, including individuals whose domain expertise promises key insights in manufacturing but who previously may not have considered using 21st century manufacturing challenges to inspire their research, and research leaders in the manufacturing community who have increasingly been focused on identifying computational solutions to advance their field. Workshop results will be published in the form of a workshop report and will be available electronically via the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The agenda for the 2-day meeting will be broken into four half-day sessions: three focused on grand challenges in the manufacturing enterprises of the 21st century and a fourth in which the first draft of the workshop report will be produced. Each of the grand challenge sessions will be co-organized by two individuals, one each from the manufacturing and computer science communities. Tentatively, the three grand challenge sessions will be: Data, Models and Representations in Manufacturing; Modular, Composable, and Open Manufacturing, and; Architecture and Virtualization, including efficiency, security, robustness.</AbstractNarration>

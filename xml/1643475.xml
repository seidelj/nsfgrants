<AbstractNarration>Students Engaging In Science and Mathematics Interdisciplinary Collaborations, or SEISMIC, is using learning communities to help low-income, academically talented students from Bridgewater State University (BSU) in Southeastern Massachusetts become confident STEM majors who experience science and mathematics as a collaborative, interdisciplinary field. SEISMIC is increasing the number of STEM graduates who possess the skills needed to address problems of modern society.  Research conducted by the SEISMIC grant team is helping to establish whether an interdisciplinary problem-based and service-learning curriculum promotes the success of academically talented, low-income STEM students.  Additionally, SEISMIC Scholars are enhancing scientific understanding and increasing public scientific literacy through service learning activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEISMIC Scholarships are helping BSU close achievement gaps in retention and graduation rates for low-income science and mathematics majors.  Students eligible for SEISMIC Scholarships are low-income students who earned a 3.0 GPA and B- or better in their introductory course in biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, mathematics or physics.  Scholars maintaining high GPAs receive awards of up to $6,000 for the final three years of their studies in BSU STEM fields. Through analysis of student work, student records data, and Likert and open-response surveys of Scholars and a control group consisting of eligible students who did not receive scholarships, the SEISMIC grant team is evaluating how participating in an interdisciplinary problem-based and service-learning curriculum leads to increases in STEM retention and motivation, as well as the development of the social, psychological and cultural capital that help graduates succeed in the workforce.</AbstractNarration>

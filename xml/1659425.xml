    <AbstractNarration>A distributed team of data and workflow facilitators ("cyberteam") from the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Utah, and Colorado State University support experimental and observational science (EOS) research as part of the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computing Consortium (RMACC). Advances in the number/diversity of data sets require enhanced capabilities to access, reuse, process, analyze, understand, curate, share, and preserve data. A critical aspect of these efforts is to provide expert support for efficient and effective workflows involving data generation, data analysis, visualization, and preservation. Typically, these activities have been the responsibilities of individual researchers, and as a result, data can be difficult to reuse by others. Likewise, computational and data generation workflows are often cobbled together, hard-coded, and not readily amenable for sharing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These problems are addressed by the distributed RMACC cyberteam who will provide support for researchers in the region by assisting them with data and workflow reuse and management. The facilitators have complementary skills and expertise, and are fully integrated into campus and regional efforts. Their focus is on data curation and metadata, and data and compute workflows, including protected information. These facilitators, in collaboration with others in the region, provide and develop regional, shared resources to support data management for small research groups and under-resourced communities, including working with regional RMACC partners.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to the University of Akron aims at discovering systematic method for controllably tethering bioactive peptides to novel polymer scaffolds for use in regenerative medicine applications. This award is also co-funded by the Biomedical Engineering program in CBET/ENG. If successful, this work will optimize peptide concentrations that enhance cell proliferation and accelerate stem cell differentiation. This knowledge would help guide the rational design of future peptide-functionalized polymer surfaces, scaffolds and hydrogels used by the wider tissue engineering community. The biological measurements will drive the design of advanced bioactive and biomimetic materials for use in many applications where synthetic materials contact biological systems. The research team is involved in the educational training components of the project. The effort will provide advanced, multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students, orthopedic surgery residents, and high school students in areas of molecular and cell biology, chemistry and polymer science. The outcomes from the research are being directly incorporated into graduate level and undergraduate courses being taught by Professor Becker. Undergraduate students from the University of Akron, and summer interns enrolled in the research experiences for undergraduates (REU) program will participate extensively. The research team's outreach activities include mentoring and provide educational and research experience for students from local high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research and the Biomedical Engineering program in CBET/ENG to the University of Akron aims at discovering a systematic method for controllably tethering multiple bioactive peptides to novel poly(ester urea) scaffolds post-3D printing for use in regenerative medicine applications. The biomaterials community clearly understands that the molecular presentation and spatial distribution of peptides and growth factors can dramatically influence many important aspects of cell behavior. This award aims to translate previously discovered GRGDS and BMP-2 peptide concentrations to translationally-relevant degradable poly(ester urea) constructs in two-dimensional thin films and three-dimensional printed scaffolds. The project will impact several fields of biomaterials including (1) developing new methods for functionalization of degradable polymer scaffolds with bioactive peptides post 3D printing and (2) new methods for characterizing surface concentrations of these peptides and (3) identification of synergistic peptide concentrations that influence hMSC cell proliferation, lineage commitment, and differentiation. The project offers multiple opportunities for the educational training of students (both undergraduate and graduate) and medical residents in advanced polymer science, state of the art chemical functionalization and translationally-relevant strategies for advanced manufacturing of 3D scaffolds. These skills will be critical to public and private entities aiming to move 3D printed scaffolds into mainstream device and regenerative medicine applications.</AbstractNarration>

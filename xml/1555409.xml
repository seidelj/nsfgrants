    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this activity is to understand the structure of complexity classes.  Complexity classes provide the best tool currently available for understanding the computational complexity of real-world computational problems.  Some of these problems are notoriously difficult, but recent progress justifies some optimism that additional useful insight about these complexity classes can be obtained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) is a well-known example of an apparently-intractable problem in NP that is not widely believed to be NP-complete.  Until now, all of the evidence that has been gathered -- trying to indicate that MCSP is hard to compute -- has followed the same path, invoking the connections between derandomization techniques and cryptographically-secure one-way functions.  This proposal will focus on developing a direct approach to reduce seemingly-hard problems to MCSP, and thereby set the stage for a more thorough understanding of the complexity of MCSP. The research results will be broadly disseminated, both through journal publications as well as through survey articles in various venues. The long-term goals of research in computational complexity, if finally achieved, will have profound impact on society (for instance, by providing firm mathematical underpinnings to public-key cryptography, which currently rests upon many unproven conjectures).</AbstractNarration>

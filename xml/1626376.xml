    <AbstractNarration>This instrumentation project, proposed by Fayetteville State University (FSU) through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program is to acquire a cathodoluminescence spectrometer that will be installed on a state-of-the-art field-emission Electron Probe Microanalyzer at a multi-user facility at FSU. It will be open for access and support research at academic and federal agencies in North Carolina, South Carolina and nationwide. The new instrument will be used for materials characterization, which will significantly strengthen the research capabilities at the FSU. The new instrument will be used as a centerpiece for training minority students at FSU, producing more minority and female professionals for diversified and motivated STEM workforces. In addition, the new capability will serve as an open platform for outreach to local communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI project supports several research projects at Fayetteville State University as the fast X-ray detection using nanoscale size and composition-controllable scintillator nanowires, effects of dimensionality, size and chemical doping on luminescence of ceria nanofibers, fundamental mechanisms controlling growth and packing factor of nanocrystals in ion implantation, and magmatic and tectonic processes by analyzing zoning in igneous and detrital zircons. Through these in situ studies, the material microstructure, shape, size, composition and luminescence properties can be correlated from the same specimens.</AbstractNarration>

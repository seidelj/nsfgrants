    <AbstractNarration>With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, is supporting Professor Eugene Chen from Colorado State University to conduct research to significantly expand the scope and utility of Lewis Pair Polymerization (LPP), especially for the synthesis of polymers from biomass-derived renewable feedstocks. Synthetic polymers are important components of a wide range of products including clothes, electronic devices, furniture, and household products. Professor Chen conducts research to develop novel catalysts and synthetic methods for the preparation of advance functional polymeric materials from biomass-derived renewable feedstocks. Important goals of this research are to develop efficient processes for the synthesis of polymers with desired properties and to reduce societal dependence on petroleum-based raw materials. This project also provides opportunities for teaching and training students in the use of a wide range of techniques important for catalyst development and polymer research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lewis pair polymerization is a powerful polymerization method, that was substantially developed in the Chen lab under support from the National Science Foundation. The specific objectives of this research are: 1) to develop stereoselective LPP for the synthesis of stereoregular or optically active chiral polymers from biomass-derived monomers; 2) to perform chemoselective LPP of biomass-based multi-vinyl monomers to yield functional polymers; and 3) to apply the LPP method for the synthesis of donor/acceptor (D/A) graft copolymers that are potentially useful for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications.</AbstractNarration>

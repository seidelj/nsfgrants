    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding for the Integers Conference 2016: Spanning the Generations, which will be held October 6-9, 2016 at the University of West Georgia, in Carrollton, Georgia; the conference website is www.westga.edu/~math/IntegersConference2016. The Integers conferences serve to bring together mathematicians and students interested in combinatorics and number theory; this will be the seventh such conference. The 2016 Integers conference will place a particular emphasis on the recruitment of undergraduate students, graduate students, and early-career mathematicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include talks on such topics as additive number theory, multiplicative number theory, combinatorial games, Ramsey theory, elementary number theory, and sequences. It will feature three plenary speakers and about sixty additional speakers. In addition to the plenary speakers, a major portion of the funding will support a number of recent REU students, graduate students, and younger faculty. The conference plans to include at least twelve student research talks. It will promote interaction among research mathematicians at all career stages from the talented undergraduate to the internationally distinguished researcher. The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special volume of the journal Integers.</AbstractNarration>

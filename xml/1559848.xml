    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) and the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) site at the University of Notre Dame. The goal of the site is to provide realistic research experiences to undergraduate students and high school physics teachers. The primary impact is in training of the next generation of scientists who will be essential for the continued well being of our society and economy, and for maintaining a robust national defense. Taking it a step further, the RET component aims at creating enthusiastic high school teachers who, in turn, will convey the excitement of physics to their students, the future physicists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participants will work with a faculty mentor on a specific research project and will be exposed to physics research in other areas via weekly seminars, workshops, interactions with other participants, and field trips to nearby national laboratories. They will participate in a "Physics Olympics" with REUs from Purdue and Michigan State Universities, prepare a research report at the end of the program, and make oral presentations at the REU-RET Symposium. They will also maintain a research logbook and will have the opportunity to attend courses in computer programming and radiation safety, as well as a GRE-preparation class and an "Applying to Graduate School" workshop . A series of workshops will also be held as part of the Ethics component. Projects will be available in the areas of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Biophysics, Cosmology, Condensed Matter Physics, High-Energy Particle Physics, Nuclear Physics, and Physics Education Research.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will offer an intellectually and socially stimulating research experience, on a vibrant and diverse set of research topics, focusing on digital communication. Increasing use of Internet in our daily lives requires research to support emerging trends in communication and information science, and education to prepare young people for rewarding careers in the decades to come.  Students involved in the program will receive extensive training in research, and valuable information about research careers, working with top faculty on exciting problems.  Each student will work with one mentor, but there will be many joint activities to create a cohort experience, and to support communication across parallel research projects, thereby enhancing scientific progress as well as student learning. This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four themes, each led by one research mentor, under the common thrust of digital connectivity: (1) The communication theme focuses on hardware and infrastructure to support communication, tackling unsolved problems of limited bandwidth and constrained protocol design in novel ways, proposing optical routers, in-network computation and extensible protocol design.  (2) The cybersecurity theme focuses on securing communication from cyberattacks and damaging activities such as cyberbullying and cyberpredation, seeking solutions for several open problems, including safe malware analysis, large denial-of-service attacks, weak passwords, and the lack of privacy-safe sources of network data.  (3) The information retrieval theme focuses on mining useful information from online sources, to achieve natural-language understanding and generation, using powerful new constructs, such as Abstract Meaning Representation, universal language translation, and the structure of poetry.  (4) The information flow theme focuses on understanding structure and communication dynamics of social systems with a novel focus on cognitive factors and their impact on communication that has already uncovered phenomena that can change the way social networks present information to users, and the way people leverage crowdsourcing.</AbstractNarration>

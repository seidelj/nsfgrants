    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a conference on Homological Mirror Symmetry held at the University of Miami from January 26 through January 31, 2015. Mirror symmetry originated in physics as a duality between superconformal quantum field theories. Maxim Kontsevich interpreted this duality in a consistent, powerful mathematical framework called Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS). The ideas put forth by Kontsevich have led to dramatic developments in how the mathematical community approaches ideas from theoretical physics, and indeed our conception of space itself. Several cutting edge developments have happened in the last year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference on Homological Mirror Symmetry at the University of Miami will serve as a perfect opportunity for a dissemination of these developments and encouragement of a wave of young, early career researchers in this subject area. The wide range of topics appearing in HMS research necessitates venues for the open exchanges of ideas in order for graduate students and early-career researchers to stay informed on current topics. The subject has developed extremely rapidly in recent years, and this conference will have an immense broader impact by bringing young people into it.

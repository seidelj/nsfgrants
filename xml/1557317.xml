    <AbstractNarration>The University of North Georgia's College of Science and Mathematics and College of Education are creating the North Georgia Undergraduate Education or NGagE program. The program will take advantage of the newly created pathway provided by the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia to prepare and certify teachers. The new program will be innovative and train STEM majors to become highly qualified STEM teachers in both STEM content and pedagogy. The program will create new courses that will integrate recognized and successful STEM practices and methodology in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science and Physics. The NGagE program will also provide extensive field experience building on UNG's successful Professional Development Community (PDC) model for training pre-service teachers. Pre-service teachers in the NGagE program will have the opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge gained through the program coursework immediately in the partnering school districts. This STEM pathway will have a significant effect on the STEM preparation in Georgia, and assist prospective teachers in overcoming barriers in pursuing STEM training through the combined efforts of a project team of scientists, educators, and community partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of North Georgia College of Science and Mathematics and College of Education propose a Capacity Building project through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program. The goal and scope of the North Georgia Undergraduate Education Program (NGagE) are to increase the number and quality of STEM secondary teachers by utilizing a newly created pathway for teacher preparation. A collaborative faculty team will analyze the needs in the UNG service area. To build capacity, the team will: 1) attract and recruit high school upperclassmen, university freshmen, undeclared majors, and practicing professionals to become STEM majors in the new pathway with the goal of increasing the number of highly prepared STEM teachers; 2) build partnerships within a Professional Development Community with schools and teachers to facilitate the training and mentoring of pre-service teachers; and 3) successfully prepare STEM teachers through the development of innovative coursework, the use of STEM faculty mentors for advising and undergraduate research, and industry partners for relevant STEM practices. The first year will entail laying the foundation for the NGagE program. The assessment of successful project development and capacity building will be both quantitative and qualitative. Program development and new coursework will be reviewed. NGagE has a unique opportunity to develop and reform secondary teacher preparation in the STEM fields in the state of Georgia.</AbstractNarration>

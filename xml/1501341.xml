    <AbstractNarration>Tropical forests harbor a remarkable level of biodiversity characterized by an exceptional number of rare species and few dominant species. Human and natural disturbances are increasingly threatening the condition of these forests and with it, their benefits to human well-being. Disentangling the causes of species relative abundance constitutes a critical step in order to protect, maintain and predict the fate of biodiversity. By studying within-species trait variation and individual growth of 650 individual trees from six species broadly distributed throughout Puerto Rico, this project will determine how functional traits influence tree species diversity. The resulting insights from this research will help to foster decisions devoted to preventing biodiversity loss in tropical forests. Further, this project will support training for science students as well as outreach efforts via public talks encouraging young people to pursue career in tropical ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identifying the ecological forces that underlie species relative abundances has been a lingering challenging in ecology. One potential explanation for this pattern is based on the idea that species have differential abilities to exploit resources heterogeneously distributed in the space and time. This ability is expected to be strongly associated with different attributes that affect the performance of individuals and ultimately their distribution and abundance. This study focuses on understanding how organismal traits influence patterns of species relative abundance. The relationship between organismal function and performance will be evaluated using in a spatially explicit context. Methods will include measuring the growth and traits of individual trees for six species distributed along an altitudinal gradient in Puerto Rico. The proposed research will expand our knowledge of the ecological mechanisms underlying patterns of species relative abundance by considering not only species identities but also trait information. Results from this project will have direct implications for natural resource management.</AbstractNarration>

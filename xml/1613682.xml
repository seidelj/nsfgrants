    <AbstractNarration>Innovative use of wireless devices such as smartphones in various mobile applications has exacerbated the congestion over cellular spectrum. On the other hand, many licensed spectrum blocks are left unused. Although cognitive radios (CR) technology has emerged as an enabler for unlicensed users to opportunistically access the unused licensed spectrum, most previous works commonly assume that each user is equipped with a CR which can operate across a wide range of spectrum. This may be possible in theory, but may not be practical for light-weight devices such as cell phones. How to effectively utilize the CR technology to build more flexible networks so that even non-CR capable devices can benefit from the opportunistic access to the unused spectrum is therefore in dire need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PIs propose a novel cognitive mesh assisted cellular network (CMCN) and investigate: 1) the architectural design of CMCN so that unoccupied licensed spectrum can be efficiently utilized and non-cognitive cellular devices can benefit from the CR technology, 2) spectrum and energy efficient CR mesh router placement under uncertain spectrum availability, 3) how to construct a fine-grained spectrum map to facilitate efficient spectrum allocation and intelligent traffic delivery, and 4) experimental validation and implementation for the proposed design. The research outcome provides a viable solution to the spectrum congestion in cellular systems. Moreover, with this flexible architecture, telecommunication industries can be rejuvenated with new innovations, leading to further development of cellular networks with high capacity and better support of new applications such as mobile healthcare, which has significant impact on individuals' lives and further provides greater opportunities for job creation and economic growth. The results of the project will be disseminated through publications and presentations. Finally, this project will actively recruit and train minority students for the future workforce and mentor junior faculty.</AbstractNarration>

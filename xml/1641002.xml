    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID award investigates whether larval nematodes, which also infect the blood of people, can increase the rate of transmission of the Zika virus. Nematode blood pathogens are parasitic worms that enter the skin and blood of people as tiny larvae and are common in Latin America and the Caribbean. The relationship between these nematodes and virus transmission has not been well studied, but there is some evidence that nematodes may enhance virus transmission. For a mosquito to become infectious and transmit the virus, the virus must pass from the mosquito's gut (after the mosquito feeds on the blood of a person infected with the virus) through the insect's gut wall, which can serve as a barrier to the virus. However, larval nematodes can penetrate the mosquito's midgut wall, potentially enhancing virus transmission into the mosquito body. This project will test the hypothesis that larval nematodes are increasing a mosquito's ability to transmit Zika. If they have this effect, treating people for these parasitic worms could reduce disease transmission. Results from this project will be relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will investigate whether people infected with larval nematodes, microfilariae, enhance the transmission of arboviruses, such as the Zika virus. After feeding on an infected host, a mosquito ingests microfilariae, which penetrate the mosquito's midgut providing a pathway for viruses obtained in the blood meal to enter the body cavity and ultimately the salivary glands. These mosquitos become more susceptible to virus transmission, which can accelerate virus development leading to more infectious mosquitos. Microfilariae can penetrate the midgut of Aedes aegypti, which is the mosquito that transmits Zika. This study will quantify midgut microfilariae penetration for Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus after being fed mixtures of microfilariae (Mansonella ozzardi) and Zika to determine the rate of viral infection and dissemination for the Zika virus.</AbstractNarration>

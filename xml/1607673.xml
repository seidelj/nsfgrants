    <AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected gravitational waves from binary black holes, verifying Einstein's predictions and opening an entirely new window onto the universe. Gravitational waves are very small, so searching for them presents great challenges in data analysis, mathematical techniques, and computation on top of the technical challenges of building and operating the instruments. A theoretical understanding of the sources of gravitational waves, such as neutron stars and black holes, can also help guide searches as well as learn about these objects from the results of the searches. Both the data analysis and theory work under this award will help transform LIGO from a prototype instrument into a tool for exploring physics and astrophysics, including the possibility of exotic particle phases and the complicated microphysics of matter under the most extreme conditions. A continuous wave signal in particular will give a direct view into the otherwise inaccessible interiors of neutron stars. As they spin down over the years, these stars can tell us about the properties of matter under the most extreme conditions since the Big Bang: supernuclear densities, relativistic speeds, superconducting and superfluid at a hundred million degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the implementation of matched filtering searches of Advanced LIGO data for continuous gravitational waves based on the Texas Tech group's code used in Initial LIGO publications; and supports development of that code to improve sensitivity and efficiency, allow more continuous gravitational wave searches, and isolate instrumental artifacts. Specific science goals are (1) directed searches for young non-pulsing neutron stars, (2) narrow-band searches for known pulsars with unusual gravitational-wave frequencies, (3) detector characterization focusing on narrow spectral lines, and (4) theoretical guidance and interpretation of searches for continuous gravitational waves, particularly from neutron-star r-modes.</AbstractNarration>

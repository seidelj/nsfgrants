    <AbstractNarration>The long term goals of high energy physicists are to identify the basic building blocks&lt;br/&gt;of matter and to determine the interactions among them that give rise to the physical world we observe.&lt;br/&gt;Major progress has been made towards these goals through the development of the standard model, which&lt;br/&gt;encompasses our current knowledge of the fundamental interactions of physics. It consists of two quantum&lt;br/&gt;field theories: the Weinberg-Salam theory of electromagnetic and weak interactions, and quantum chromodynamics&lt;br/&gt;(QCD), the theory of the strong interactions. The standard model has been enormously successful&lt;br/&gt;in explaining a wealth of data produced in accelerator and cosmic ray experiments over the past forty years.&lt;br/&gt;However, high energy physicists believe that a more general theory will be needed to explain physics at the&lt;br/&gt;shortest distances or highest energies. The standard model is expected to be the low energy limit of this&lt;br/&gt;more general theory, and a great deal of the experimental effort in high energy physics is directed towards&lt;br/&gt;the search for physical phenomena that will require theoretical ideas beyond the standard model for their&lt;br/&gt;understanding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project directly supports this effort by carrying out ground-breaking simulations on Blue Waters. &lt;br/&gt;In order to understand where the standard model might break down and new physics enter, one must, of&lt;br/&gt;course, determine its predictions and compare them with experiment. This is particularly challenging for&lt;br/&gt;quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the component of the standard model that describes the strong interactions&lt;br/&gt;of sub-atomic physics. At present, the only means of extracting many of the most important predictions&lt;br/&gt;of QCD from first principles and with controlled errors is through large scale numerical simulations&lt;br/&gt;of the type that will be carried out on Blue Waters. These simulations play an important role in efforts to&lt;br/&gt;obtain a deeper understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the project has a long standing policy to make the large&lt;br/&gt;data sets (gauge configurations and quark propagators) produced and codes developed publicly&lt;br/&gt;available. Based on past experience, the project anticipates that the data sets and codes created for the project&lt;br/&gt;will be used by others in a wide variety of calculations important in high energy and nuclear&lt;br/&gt;physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, lattice QCD has been a fruitful training ground for doctoral and postdoctoral students. Those entering the&lt;br/&gt;field must obtain a broad knowledge of computer hardware and software, in addition to a solid background in&lt;br/&gt;physics. As a result, scientists trained in this field have a wide range of employment opportunities inside and&lt;br/&gt;outside of academia. There are approximately seventy-five&lt;br/&gt;young scientists in training in this field in the United States at the present time. Some will benefit from&lt;br/&gt;working on the project, and many more from the code and data sets produced by it.</AbstractNarration>

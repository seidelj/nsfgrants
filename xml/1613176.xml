    <AbstractNarration>The Fifth Workshop on Biostatistics and Bioinformatics will be held on the campus of Georgia State University, Atlanta, May 5-7, 2017. The objective of the workshop is to reflect new developments in the frontiers of biostatistics and bioinformatics. The conference will cover a broad range of current research topics, including high-dimensional and big data analysis, high-throughput genomics data analysis, survival analysis, and empirical likelihood methods. The invited speakers will include leading experts and outstanding junior researchers. The workshop will provide opportunities for the exchange of new ideas and genesis of research collaborations. Graduate students and postdocs will gain valuable research experience by attending the workshop and making poster presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of approximately 12 graduate students and junior faculty. The conference organizers are making special efforts to provide travel support for a diverse group of researchers to attend the workshop. Participants from underrepresented groups are encouraged to attend and apply for travel support.

    <AbstractNarration>1523702&lt;br/&gt;Sharp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grant Proposal to Support Participation of US Researchers at the Intensification of Resource Recovery Forum 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are numerous challenges associated with the sustainable production of safe water, energy and food and to address these challenges the water industry has identified wastewater as a viable and sustainable source for not only quality water, but recoverable energy and nutrient resources. Recently, it has been understood that wastewater contains valuable resources such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Carbon in wastewater can be recovered to generate energy, while nitrogen and phosphorus recovery can supplement nutrient demand for agriculture. This conference will establish actionable roadmaps for the further development, demonstration, and implementation of technologies that intensify resource recovery at wastewater treatment plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Conference includes realizing the full potential of resource recovery at wastewater treatment plants through active participation of all stakeholders in the development, testing, and implementation of intensifying technologies. The original paradigm of wastewater treatment to protect public health and improve environmental quality has begun to shift, and now includes sustainable energy production and resource recovery. To support this paradigm shift, the water industry must actively develop, demonstrate and implement new resource recovery technologies to maximize benefit, and reduce the cost and unintended environmental consequences of traditional wastewater treatment technologies. This conference program includes both a "technology pull" and a "technology push" strategy. Drivers for resource recovery and energy neutrality include decreased energy demand and carbon emissions, marketable commodities, and improved efficiency at reduced cost. This conference will actively engage researchers in the development and demonstration of technologies aimed at intensifying resource recovery, allowing them to lead the paradigm shift and create new opportunities for sustainable resource recovery.</AbstractNarration>

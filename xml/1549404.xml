    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes not only assistive technology for the severely motion-disabled, who currently find it impossible to use a touchscreen, but also many who are not officially diagnosed with a motion disability. Initial sales to this wealthier, typically elderly, US audience will pay &gt;$50, helping to fund company growth. Phase I experiments will add new scientific insights in HCI. Phase I will yield a low-cost accessory that, in large-scale production, will ultimately have a ~$10 price that is similar to the existing market for styli and texting gloves, which are of limited benefit to the motion-disabled, and more cost effective than accessories such as electronic pens. This low-cost, single-chip accessory can be scaled up in manufacturing efforts to enfranchise hundreds of millions of motion-disabled individuals worldwide. The proposed device will be operating-system and device independent, and will require lower development costs than competing hardware such as electric pens. If the proposed technology were to be commercialized successfully at a reasonable price, millions in the US (and many times that worldwide) marginalized by the touchscreen revolution will be able to fully participate in the innovations these devices bring to society. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to improve Human Computer Interaction (HCI) for (~34 million US) motion-disabled users who struggle with capacitive touchscreens. These screens assume users' fingers act as intermittently connected capacitors. The motion-disabled are unable perform such gestures. Software-only adaptations and the well-established accessories (styli or texting gloves) do not help the motion-disabled. This project combines an inexpensive hardware accessory, a custom chip and an extra-software-layer running on the touchscreen operating system (OS). Many motion-disabled are low-income individuals who require low-cost, single-chip accessories?yet such chips have too much parasitic capacitance. This project is designed to 1) demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating touchscreen accessories that reliably encode low-bandwidth information from the motion-disabled into the signals received by a capacitance touchscreen; 2) develop extra-software-layer applications that interface such accessories for motion disabilities in human-subject evaluation; and 3) design a chip for such accessories that overcomes cost and parasitic-capacitance problems. Feedback from human-subject and electronic measurements allow simultaneously optimization of three interrelated issues: hardware reliability, accessory form-factor, and the extra-software-layer functionality. Results will include subjective and objective human-subject evaluations, accessory form factor, low-parasitic-capacitance integrated-circuit design, code, and OS/application interfacing techniques for such accessories.</AbstractNarration>

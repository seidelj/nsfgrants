    <AbstractNarration>1565318 &lt;br/&gt;Keasling, Jay D.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to convene experts in synthetic biology and related fields to identify broad principles and methods to translate fundamental discoveries from synthetic biology into useful bio manufacturing platforms. It is anticipated that the workshop will generate new ideas towards the next steps of leveraging the potential of synthetic biology for new technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will survey a broad array of topics, including protein folding, metabolic pathways, cellular and tissue engineering, and evolutionary forces, to identify new research and educational directions that can capitalize on advances in synthetic biology and lead to innovative manufacturing methods and products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is co-sponsored by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET, the Office of Emerging Frontiers and Multidisciplinary Activities, the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program of the Division of Chemistry and by the Physics of Living Systems Program of the Division of Physics.</AbstractNarration>

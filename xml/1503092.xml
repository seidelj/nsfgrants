    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a workshop on methodological challenges across the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, to be held at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, VA in February 2015. The results of the workshop will contribute to long-run strategic thinking about quantitative work in the social and behavioral sciences and the methodological advances that are needed to move the social, behavioral, and economic sciences forward. Possible dissemination mechanisms include journal submissions or an edited volume and a supervised online blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will bring together methodologists from across the social, behavioral, economic, and statistical sciences to help identify challenges to and opportunities for furthering methodological developments across these disciplines. Potential research topics to be discussed include new data definitions, modeling and estimation, null results, and data privacy. Workshop participants also will explore methods for facilitating continued communication among methodologists across disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

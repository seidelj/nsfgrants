    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support to allow students and postdocs from U.S. universities to participate in the fifteenth meeting of the International Symposium on Ultrafast Intense Laser Science (ISUILS15), to be held October 2-7, 2016, in Cassis, France. This Symposium is held in the United States one out of every five years, and offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists from across the United States and the broader international community. As it is being held outside of the U.S. this year, it is being supported by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering. The support of students through this award makes a substantial contribution to the education and training of future U.S. scientists. Students who graduate with a background in the Symposium topic subdiscipline (atomic, molecular, and optical physics) acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Symposium is on a topic that is receiving particular emphasis this year because of a number of reports, such as (1) "Optics and Photonics: Essential Technologies for Our Nation," from the National Research Council, (2) "Fast-Track Action Committee on Optics and Photonics: Building a Brighter Future with Optics and Photonics," from the National Science and Technology Council, and (3) "Optics and Photonics: Transformative Research Opportunities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences," from the NSF Mathematics and Physical Sciences Advisory Committee.</AbstractNarration>

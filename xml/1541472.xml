    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will provide a valuable opportunity for U.S. and Israeli experts in the fields of clinical data mining, data analytics and precision medicine to meet to discuss their respective research efforts and the potential for partnerships. The goal of the workshop is to create mutually beneficial research collaborations that will improve research efforts in computing for precision medicine applications. The research collaborations that are formed will potentially result in improvements in personalized medicine that can lead to better medical outcomes for people in the U.S. and around the world. Connecting top U.S. researchers in the academic and private sector with their counterparts in Israel has strong potential to improve data analytics for precision medicine applications, resulting in better analyses, more accurate diagnoses, more effective treatments and improved therapeutic success rates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF has funded several Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRCs) with focus on this area, notably the Center for Advanced Knowledge Enablement (CAKE) and the Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR) whose members and affiliates will contribute the majority of the U.S. participants to this meeting. Israeli participants will include primarily researchers from the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology), Tel Aviv University and representatives from Israeli businesses working in data analytics and precision medicine applications, as well as Israeli government personnel interested in encouraging pre-competitive, industry-supported research and partnership with US researchers in these areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting is timely and of strategic value because of the noted expertise of Israeli researchers in the academic and industrial sector in both data analytics and personalized medicine and because of the investments that Israel is making in industry-relevant basic research. This meeting provides a tremendous opportunity for new collaborations to be initiated which are likely to be of tremendous value to advancing U.S. research efforts on information technologies for precision medicine. In addition, new international partners may be recruited to join U.S. I/UCRCs and new market opportunities will be discovered by the U.S. I/UCRC members.</AbstractNarration>

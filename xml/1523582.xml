    <AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together researchers from around the world to identify the "Grand Challenge" questions that can be addressed through studies of Quantum Fluids and Solids. Past studies in this area have brought forth new phenomena, such as many different forms of superfluidity, as well as serving as a testing ground for new ideas in condensed matter physics, such as the renormalization group. This workshop, which will take place as a satellite meeting to the 2015 International Conference on Quantum Fluids and Solids, will offer the opportunity for researchers in the quantum fluids and solids community as well as from related disciplines to identify the grand challenge problems where the study of quantum fluids and solids can contribute. It will also provide an opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and young faculty to interact with more senior researchers. The results of the workshop will be published in a leading peer reviewed journal.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I projec is wide ranging due to the flexibility of the laser source design. The goal of the proposed work is an innovative approach to the development of a new class of compact, low cost, high-power laser sources at wavelengths that are currently difficult to achieve while providing addition functionality with no additional power consumption. This will make a highly efficient laser package. In addition to the application rich mid-IR, the laser design can easily be extended to other wavelengths in the far-IR, THz, visible, and UV portions of the spectrum. The approach can have a significant impact in many technical fields. The discoveries made within the scope of this program will have a transformative impact in mid- to far-IR lasers and has the ability to benefit disciplines including: laser surgery, dental surgery, dermatology, atmospheric monitoring, chemical sensing, and a broad range of defense applications including LADAR and laser range finding. In addition to the technological impact, the proposed research will cover multiple disciplines in science and engineering including high energy material properties, semiconductor physics, nonlinear optics and laser physics which will provide a unique research opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the need for versatile laser sources operating in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral region. Currently available lasers sources are limited in their capabilities. Wavelength selection and maximum output powers are limited, and efficiency, reliability and costs are also issues. High-power vertical external cavity surface emitting lasers (VECSEL) which employs multiple chip arrangements have the potential to reach wavelengths that are not easily attainable in a very compact package. In addition, the introduction of multiple laser cavities provides a means for generating outputs in the near-IR with no additional power consumption. Using a high power doubly-resonant two-color T-cavity VECSEL, efficient difference frequency conversion will be achieved. High power outputs in the mid-IR (8-12 Âµm) spectral region will be demonstrated through a novel design in which the VECSEL chips will contain multiple laser cavities that can provide broad spectral coverage in the near-IR from the same device. This will lead to enhanced efficiency and provide more capabilities such as laser targeting and range finding with no additional power consumption.</AbstractNarration>

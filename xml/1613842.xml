<AbstractNarration>Neutrino physics probes a wide range of unknown physics, including the nature of neutrino oscillations and the ordering of the neutrino masses. The T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment in Japan is making precision measurements of important experimental values related to neutrino physics. As T2K tries to improve the precision of their findings, better modeling methods must be included in order to keep pace with experimental measurements. This award support research at the University of Tokyo with Dr. Yoshinari Hayato to improve the simulation software, NEUT, used by T2K. Dr. Hayato is the maintainer of the simulation software used by T2K, providing direct access to the person who best understands how the software should work.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The current model for deep inelastic scattering (DIS) used in the simulation software for T2K is likely to be outdated and needs to be updated. The PI will compare the DIS model in NEUT against T2K data and a large variety of other data available, so that an understanding can be developed as to where the model excels and where it begins to break down. By understanding where the model begins to break down, work can be done either to improve the current model itself, or create a new model that correctly represents the world's data in the region(s) where the model breaks down. While not the dominant interaction process, DIS is still a key interaction mechanism between neutrinos and nucleons at the T2K experiment. Because of its importance, finding a model that accurately portrays the process, both in predicting outcomes and fitting existing data, is crucial. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This small scientific conference focuses on the chromosomes of fungi, including baker`s yeast as well as other useful as well as harmful fungi. In addition to their many roles in decay and turnover of living matter in the biosphere, fungi (yeasts, molds, mushrooms, etc) are convenient organisms to study how living cells copy their chromosomes, divide in two, and then rebuild their nuclei with the right number of chromosomes in them. This conference brings together scientists that work on this subject. The organizers have come up with several formats that give opportunities to the young scientists to present and discuss their research with the more experienced mentors from all over the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FASEB Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replication, and Segregation Meeting surveys the knowledge of the simple model systems that have allowed several recent breakthroughs in understanding of eukaryotic chromosome biology. First presented to the community at the earlier conferences in this series, some of such breakthroughs include fine mapping of functions in DNA replication, single-molecule analysis of early event in replication origin recognition, detailed mapping of meiotic recombination, kinetochore ultrastructure, etc. The organizers make a case that the relatively narrow scope of the biological processes under study, combined with the broad arsenal of technical approaches presented during the meetings make them a uniquely intense training experience for the participants. Broader impact of the conference includes the ongoing experimentation with the presentations` format, allowing a high proportion of talks to be presented by postdoc-level scientists, in sessions chaired and mediated by accomplished investigators.</AbstractNarration>

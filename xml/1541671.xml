    <AbstractNarration>The activity will fund an invitation only workshop to explore fundamental issues pertaining to the computer architectures of the future. Due to the end of (Dennard) scaling and Moore's law regimes the ever increasing performance of computing machines have stalled in recent years. This may have strong negative implications not only on technological advancement but on the economy and society as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main technical bottlenecks in moving forward with new computer architectures has been the issue of power dissipation in miniaturized electronic circuits. This particular issue among other important issues will be given due importance in the discussion. Leading researchers from industry, academia and government will assemble to explore future technical directions for a solution to the problem. The results of the discussion and recommendations of the group will be made available for broader dissemination by industry, academic communities as well as funding agencies.</AbstractNarration>

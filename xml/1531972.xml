    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Indiana State University will acquire an ultra-high pressure liquid chromatograph interfaced with a linear ion trap mass spectrometer capable of data-dependent tandem mass spectrometery. The system will be used to separate and analyze the composition of mixtures of substances obtained from various sources including samples obtained from chemical reactions, energy-related research and batteries used for energy storage. In this instrument the liquid samples are allowed to pass through columns filled with substances that interact to various degrees with the sample components and thus the components move at different speeds through the columns. This process allows separation of the components. These species are then analyzed using the mass spectrometer in which the components are ionized and their masses are determined by measuring the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of the ions. This is a widely used analytical tool to determine the composition of a mixture or material. Students will be trained to use this modern instrumentation while working in their research, preparing them for their later careers. The instrument will enable new undergraduate laboratory and research experiences. It will also be used in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE) program which engages a large number of undergraduate students across the sciences. Besides serving multiple departments at ISU, it will support users from neighboring institutions including St. Mary-of-the-Woods College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be used in research especially in areas such as (a) isolating, synthesizing and structural elucidating neuroactive natural products; (b) analyzing multimodal signaling systems in sceloporus lizards; (c) correlating analysis of organics and volatile trace elements in carbonaceous chondrites; (d) carrying out cleavage analysis of plant and fungal tyrosinases; and (e) carrying out applications of gas-phase ion molecule chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

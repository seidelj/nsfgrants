    <AbstractNarration>The Fifty-seventh Midwest Graph Theory Conference will be held at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio from the 8th to 9th April 2016. The conference will be on Friday and Saturday to make it easy for researchers to attend. The conference will feature three plenary one-hour speakers and a number of contributed talks, each of twenty minutes long. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is part of a series of conferences devoted to graph theory and its applications. Ever since Dr. Frank Harary hosted the first conference at the University of Michigan in 1978, it has been held almost every year at different institutions in the Midwest and nearby regions. Many world-leading experts in graph theory have given principle talks in past conferences. About 60 participants are anticipated, with about 40 contributed talks in parallel sessions. The conference will be publicized using distribution lists and on related conference websites (a conference website is at http://www.cs.bsu.edu/homepages/mighty/) featuring titles and abstracts of the speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature current research in the area of graph theory and its applications. Researchers will present their new results and there will be time for open discussions to explore unsolved problem in the field. The confirmed plenary speakers are Dr. Neil Robertson, Dr. Ping Zhang, from Western Michigan University, and Dr. K.T. Arasu, a recent recipient of the Trustee's Award for Faculty Excellence at Wright State University.</AbstractNarration>

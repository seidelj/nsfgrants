<AbstractNarration>1638557 - Ronney&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed funding will be used to offset costs for students to travel to the 36th International Symposium on Combustion, Seoul, Korea, August 1 - 5, 2016. The supported students are expected to have authored or co-authored accepted papers and to present them in person at the Symposium. It is anticipated that the funds will support 40 students. The International Symposium on Combustion is the most prestigious technical conference in the combustion community. By attending this meeting, students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art combustion research and have a chance to network with other researchers and practicing engineers. This experience will greatly enhance their technical knowledge as well as professional careers.</AbstractNarration>

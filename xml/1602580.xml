<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project generally aims to develop a multi-scale model-proxy synthesis to explore the relationship between multi-decadal ENSO variability and tropical Pacific seas surface temperature (SST) gradients in past climates and help assess model skill in simulating these relationships in past, present, and potential future climates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activity of El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) varies significantly at multi-decadal to centennial timescales, even in the absence of external forcing.  Periods of increased ENSO activity may affect the mean state of the tropical Pacific, via a decrease of the zonal SST gradient due to residual heating from large El Niño events.  In turn, ENSO-modulated multi-decadal variations of the zonal SST gradient can exert influence on global temperature trends.  These causal links are argued to be poorly constrained in models and observations, at present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The merit of the project is high because it identifies an interesting scientific issue (i.e., the ENSO-mean state interaction) that is important for advancing our understanding the dynamics of ENSO and decadal climate variability that can benefit from using paleo-climate proxies. The anticipated results have the potential to aid in interpreting the decadal variability observed in the present-day climate and the selection of climate models that have the potential to make more accurate projections of future climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts involve the potential for creating increased confidence in theory and models of future climate in the tropics; helping create a new generation of earth scientists willing to bridge the divide between the worlds of modeling and paleoclimate data; support two early career female scientists; and support two doctoral students.</AbstractNarration>

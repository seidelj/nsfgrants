    <AbstractNarration>Global-mean sea level is projected to rise by roughly one meter over the next 85 years. These changes are expected to detrimentally impact mangrove and coastal wetland habitats that contain high levels of species diversity. Of particular concern is Singapore that on average lies only 15 m above sea level and has lost much of its native mangrove habitat. Many semi-aquatic snake species of the family Homalopsidae rely on this imperiled habitat and changes in sea-level could cause species extirpations. Particularly concerning is the fact that many of these poorly understood snakes are found nowhere else and new species are described regularly. As regulating predators in coastal ecosystems, snake losses could result in unnatural levels of some prey species, such as fish and crustaceans, and the disappearance of others - directly impacting fisheries and other economically important coastal recreational activities. In this study, semi-aquatic snakes will be sampled across Singapore to gather information on distribution and abundance necessary for predicting species responses to sea level rise. This research is in collaboration with Dr. David Bickford at the National University of Singapore, a world-renowned expert in evolutionary ecology and conservation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Occupancy analysis will be used to model species occupancy, detectability, and habitat associations for semi-aquatic snake species. Up to 30 coastal sites representing a gradient from pristine (i.e. National Parks) to sites heavily influenced by urban development will be sampled. Surveys will be conducted at night in mangroves, intertidal creeks and mud flats at low tides when snakes are most active. Habitat and landscape variables such as salinity, land cover, urban land use, and vegetation cover will be included as covariates, to assess relationships between natural and anthropogenic factors and species occupancy and diversity. Predicted distribution maps for each species will be created using the results from occupancy modeling. Potentially inundated areas will be mapped using multiple probabilistic sea level rise scenarios for estimating impacts on costal habitat. These maps will then be overlaid to estimate impacts on species persistence. This study is the first of its kind investigating occupancy parameters in Asian snakes and responses of snakes to projected sea-level rise. This award is funded in collaboration with the National University of Singapore.</AbstractNarration>

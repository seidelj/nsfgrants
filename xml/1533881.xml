    <AbstractNarration>The goal of SPANDAN project is to create a novel architecture-independent framework &lt;br/&gt;for designing efficient, portable and scalable parallel algorithms for analyzing &lt;br/&gt;large-scale dynamic networks. SPANDAN will not only provide an intuitive methodology &lt;br/&gt;for efficiently translating sequential algorithms into scalable parallel algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for dynamic networks, but also provide mechanisms for their analytical evaluation and &lt;br/&gt;serve as a mediatory layer between applications and system level tuning. To evaluate &lt;br/&gt;the effectiveness of SPANDAN framework in real-world applications, the PIs will &lt;br/&gt;collaborate with social scientists and biologists. They will also integrate research &lt;br/&gt;findings into various courses such as network analysis, parallel algorithms, and &lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics. They will further collaborate with high schools to develop summer courses &lt;br/&gt;with the goal of encouraging women and minority students to pursue IT-related careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the underlying methodology, the SPANDAN framework will exploit graph sparsification &lt;br/&gt;techniques to divide the network into sparse subgraphs (certificates) that form the &lt;br/&gt;leaves of a sparsification tree. This innovative approach will lead to the design and &lt;br/&gt;analysis of efficient parallel algorithms for updating dynamic networks, and reduction &lt;br/&gt;of memory latency associated with parallelizing unstructured data. Specifically parallel &lt;br/&gt;algorithms will be designed for maintaining network topological characteristics, and &lt;br/&gt;updating influential vertices and communities. To demonstrate portability and performance, &lt;br/&gt;the developed algorithms will be implemented on the distributed memory clusters, shared &lt;br/&gt;memory multicores, and massively multithreaded CRAY-XMT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at:&lt;br/&gt; http://cs.mst.edu/labs/crewman/projects/SPANDAN/</AbstractNarration>

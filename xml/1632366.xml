    <AbstractNarration>This award will partially support a conference focused on Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) planned for May 16-19, 2016, at the University of Wisconsin, under the sponsorship of the Microanalysis Society (MAS). Quantitative analysis by EPMA is fundamental to earth and materials sciences. Analytical skills obtained by students are valuable and form a foundation for quantitative techniques that are related to x-ray spectrometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned topical conference will be the first conference or workshop explicitly focused on electron microprobe analysis in many years, providing an opportunity for experienced scientists to interact with students and researchers new to the technique. The EPMA user community is much broader than members of any one organization or professional society, and one aim is to attract all users of electron probes and provide them with four days of valuable experiences to take back to their laboratories. In addition, the conference is designed to facilitate interaction between materials scientists and geologists who have much to learn from each other but may rarely have venues to interact.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This award, funded by the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI), brings new research and teaching capabilities to four Departments/schools at the College of Science and Engineering at San Francisco State University (SFSU) via acquisition of a multipurpose microscope (Bio-AFM). This instrument (Bio-AFM) combines two powerful microscopes: (1) a fluorescence microscope that provides detailed optical images of translucent biological samples, such as cells and soft tissues, and (2) an atomic force microscope (AFM) that provides high-resolution contour maps of samples as well as a broad range of physical properties, such as force, friction, and electric potential. The lack of quantitative techniques in biological sciences has forced researchers to use traditional assessment tools that are typically subjective or not completely quantitative. This instrument will close this gap by empowering development of new quantitative techniques to detect the small effect of medications and medical interventions that occur at the molecular and cellular scales. The techniques will allow researchers to study aging and genetic predisposition by accurately measuring their affects on physical properties of the tissues in micro and nano scales. The instrument will serve as a catalyst for stimulating interdisciplinary collaborations within the college as well as with external users and colleagues at universities, research organizations, and private industries across the Bay Area. The Bio-AFM serves as a critical pedagogical tool in interdepartmental courses designed to offer Masters and undergraduate students hands-on experiences. It will also expand opportunities for recruiting, retaining, and engaging students at a large, urban, comprehensive university with a significant population of individuals who are traditionally under-represented in the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Exposure to this state-of-the-art imaging and data acquisition system will augment the training experiences of students and help prepare them for Ph.D. programs or professional careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award promotes a number of new collaborative research projects that will allow in-depth characterization of the mechanical, electrical, and optical properties of natural and engineered materials, as well as imaging of a wide variety of samples, ranging from soft biological tissues to hard metals. The instrument, with its uniquely integrated fluorescence microscope, cutting-edge actuation system, and advanced controls, will ensure the development of open source, quantitative assessment tools that enable any modern AFM to capture the comprehensive micro-mechanics and nano-dynamics of soft biomaterials by finding intrinsic bi-phasic characteristics including elasticity and permeability. Use of the Bio-AFM by SFSU researchers will also enable research advances in the following areas: detecting subtle effects of multiple biological factors such as age and genetic modification on the functions and mechanics of biological materials by using the force indentation tools of the AFM as well as the explained quantitative assessment tool; understanding the impact of different synthesis conditions on the formation and conductivity of polycrystalline thin films under ultraviolet illumination, commonly used in photoelectrochemical applications by using the conductive AFM technique; elucidating the effects of key fabrication parameters on the surface characteristics and mechanical properties of meso-scale materials for energy and filtration applications, by direct mapping and quantification of the surface roughness of electrospun fibers; investigating extracellular organelles synthesized by bacteria and measuring adhesive forces generated by these organelles using the AFM imaging capabilities and the integrated fluorescent microscope; and evaluating the strength of cell-cell interactions by detecting morphological changes and mapping the electrostatic surface potential by using the conductive AFM technique.</AbstractNarration>

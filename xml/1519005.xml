    <AbstractNarration>This project examines how the brain becomes specialized to learn language over development using state-of-the-art functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Previous fMRI developmental studies have only examined one age group, have examined a wide age range (i.e., from kindergarten through adolescence) and/or have not examined multiple aspects of language processing in the same children. This project will overcome previous shortcomings by studying the same individuals at two time points during a period of rapid language development (5 to 7 years of age). Longitudinal approaches (following the same individual over time) are rarely used in developmental brain imaging research, but are crucial for gaining insights into how the brain acquires language. This study will also overcome previous shortcomings by using multiple language tasks, revealing developmental changes in specialization of brain function. A significant strength of this research is the use of behavioral evidence in the study of language development to generate questions regarding brain development. The study evaluates the novel hypothesis that greater connectivity between brain regions early in development results in increasing specialization of brain regions later in development. This project will integrate research and education by providing training to a post-doctoral research associate and several undergraduate students. This project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by providing in depth internships for high school students from underrepresented minorities. Project dissemination will occur widely, not only through professional journals and conferences, but also to audiences consisting of high school students, undergraduates, parents, teachers and administrators. This project will fundamentally advance the field's understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying language acquisition in early childhood, while also laying the groundwork for future investigations of language impairment in this age range.</AbstractNarration>

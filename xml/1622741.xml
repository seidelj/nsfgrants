    <AbstractNarration>Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Over 1.7&lt;br/&gt;million people sustain a brain injury each year and make up one-third of all injuries seen in the&lt;br/&gt;emergency room. Developing rehabilitation and treatment strategies to manage this disease are&lt;br/&gt;important, but preventing the occurrence of brain trauma is also critical component to the solution.&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this proposal is to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury through smart technology&lt;br/&gt;that collects sensory data to predict and characterize head impact in real-time, optimizes protective&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms based on those impact characteristics, and sends impact trauma attributes to a clinical&lt;br/&gt;database for further analysis and injury risk prediction. This technology will substantially improve&lt;br/&gt;traumatic brain injury prevention and diagnosis in motor vehicle crashes, sports, and industrial&lt;br/&gt;accidents. To accomplish this goal, fundamental research efforts include (1) real-time situational&lt;br/&gt;monitoring to predict when and how dangerous impacts are about to occur and (2) active&lt;br/&gt;prevention mechanisms to reduce the risk of brain injury impact. Initial evaluation of the&lt;br/&gt;technology is in a sports setting, but the system components can be widely adaptive for&lt;br/&gt;implementation in motor vehicles, industrial safety helmets, and living environments for the&lt;br/&gt;elderly.&lt;br/&gt;The research goals of this proposal are to (1) reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury through&lt;br/&gt;advanced situational monitoring, musculoskeletal activation, and impact-specific force reduction;&lt;br/&gt;and (2) to improve potential identification of head injury risk based on multiscale brain&lt;br/&gt;deformation modeling. These goals are accomplished by integrating four fundamental research&lt;br/&gt;efforts. First, tracking and collision detection algorithms are developed based on radio frequency&lt;br/&gt;(RF) sensing, processing, and flexible antenna design. When used in conjunction with triaxial&lt;br/&gt;accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, these algorithms provide the sensing capabilities&lt;br/&gt;required to detect objects, capture directional velocity data of surrounding objects, and process&lt;br/&gt;data in real-time to determine probabilities and characteristics of impending collision. Second,&lt;br/&gt;musculoskeletal clenching following auditory warning is investigated as a means of minimizing&lt;br/&gt;head angular acceleration following head or body impact. The development of auditory warning&lt;br/&gt;cues and muscle clench strategies utilizes kinematic musculoskeletal modeling and human subject&lt;br/&gt;studies to identify required auditory cues and response times as well as muscle activation&lt;br/&gt;parameters that best mitigate head angular acceleration during a collision. Third, active force&lt;br/&gt;reduction specific to impending impact characteristics are implemented using a unique controllable&lt;br/&gt;air-filled bladder. Optimal pressure and deflection characteristics of the bladder are based on&lt;br/&gt;impact velocity and direction, and evaluated with a novel three-dimensional multiscale finite&lt;br/&gt;element model of the human head. This model incorporates anatomical variability in the&lt;br/&gt;microstructures at the brain-skull interface, a region that is critical to predictions of head injury.&lt;br/&gt;The fourth fundamental research area uses the multiscale model to investigate the relationship of&lt;br/&gt;head impact force and acceleration to regional deformation of brain tissue upon impact. These&lt;br/&gt;studies will be used to improve predictions of TBI risk from impact kinematics.</AbstractNarration>

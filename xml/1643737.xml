    <AbstractNarration>The Iona College DESIRE program supports twenty-four (24) economically disadvantaged students with high academic aptitude, for scholarships in STEM fields, through targeted, hands-on high school outreach and recruitment programs. The STEM disciplines targeted by the DESIRE program include Chemistry and Computer Science. To ensure intellectual merit, the DESIRE Program uses proven high-impact educational practices (HIEPs) to develop the Academic, Professional, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, and Intercultural dimensions of scholarship recipients for success in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These Scholars will be exposed to HIEPs that increase student retention, and will benefit from the various resources at Iona dedicated to intervention, resilience, and enrichment: tailored core courses, an interdisciplinary academic learning community, a science living and learning community residence, undergraduate research, and experiential/service learning. For professional development, the scholars will be offered industrial internships and professional mentors through Careers in Science seminars and established science alumni network. The DESIRE program will serve as a model for peer institutions for the improvement of their programs to support and retain students in STEM. The broader impacts of the program ensure that STEM workforce needs are addressed and highly trained STEM professionals willing to embrace scientific pursuits at the graduate and professional levels are produced. The high school partnership will provide an enduring and sustainable pipeline for identification and matriculation of high caliber students with financial need. The DESIRE program will lead to completion of STEM degrees by an increased number of underrepresented students, and an increased number of underrepresented high school students becoming interested in STEM careers.</AbstractNarration>

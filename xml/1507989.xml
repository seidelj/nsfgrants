    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Dodds and his research group at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln are developing new analytical tools for rapidly discriminating isomeric carbohydrate species. Complex carbohydrate structures are known to be essential for many the most crucial processes of life, yet their chemical complexity has limited the ability to fully understand many of their biological roles. This complexity represents a significant barrier, since very subtle differences between carbohydrate structures can drastically affect their activities in living systems. Professor Dodds is working to establish new methods for distinguishing between carbohydrates that are very similar chemically, but may be very distinct biologically. His approach takes advantage of how carbohydrates interact with various metals in ways that allow closely related structures to be differentiated using analytical approaches such as tandem mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry. This work may lead to new insights on how metals can serve as probes of carbohydrate structure and facilitate the rapid structural discrimination of carbohydrate isomers. Professor Dodds also works closely with postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, especially women students, by providing them with unique interdisciplinary training opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project develops a novel method to enable understanding of carbohydrate/metal ion interactions. The approach uses cationic charge carriers as probes of carbohydrate structure in conjunction with both tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). This work also employs gas-phase electron transfer reactions to expand the catalog of these structural probes to include those that cannot be accessed in solution. Overall, this research provides the means to leverage gas phase carbohydrate / metal ion interactions and gas-phase ion chemistry to generate cationic, isomeric species in which isomers adopt characteristic, distinguishing conformations and undergo unique, structurally-informative, unimolecular dissociation processes upon vibrational activation.</AbstractNarration>

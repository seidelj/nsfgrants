<AbstractNarration>Jobs in lasers, precision optics, camera systems, photonics, and other technical areas that employ the science of light are essential aspects of our nation's technical competitiveness. The results of a recent national survey of photonics industries in the US conducted by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) National Center, OP-TEC, showed that, in the Western US, companies currently employ nearly 5000 photonics technicians, and projected a need for over 1100 additional technicians over the five-year period following the survey. Irvine Valley College (IVC) is leveraging an NSF award in photonics that has led to the development of for-credit courses and an Associates' Degree program in Laser and Photonics Technology to recruit both additional industry and educational partners. Together the partners will develop a plan for a Regional Center in Photonics in the western US to respond to industry need for photonics technicians.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This planning effort brings together industry and educational partners from the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming to develop a comprehensive plan for a Regional Center in Optics and Photonics that would prepare students for entry-level technical positions in the industry. IVC will continue to work with the ATE National Center, OP-TEC, during the planning process.</AbstractNarration>

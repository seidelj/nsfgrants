    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel potassium-oxygen (K-O2) rechargeable battery technology to fill the increasing need for high performance batteries for transportation electrification and stationary energy storage. The K-O2 battery is important because it effectively provides better-than-Li-ion battery performance at less-than-sealed-lead-acid battery price. This novel energy-dense battery technology has the unique feature that its operation is based on the reversible one-electron oxygen/superoxide redox couple, which eliminates the need for high-cost electrocatalysts. This feature provides the following advantages: low cost, lightweight, high-energy efficiency and environmental friendly when compared to the foremost competing lithium-ion batteries and other metal-oxygen batteries in this market space. The technology would enable electric vehicles to travel longer ranges at affordable prices and solve the energy-storage problem on the electrical grid system when using intermittent renewable energies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a prototype of potassium-oxygen battery pack. This will require investigation into the following technology gaps to translate from research discovery toward commercial application: developing moisture-responsive electrolytes, safe anodes alternative to potassium metal, and functional potassium cation selective membranes with low oxygen permeation for anode protection to improve the battery cycle life. The fundamental limitation of potassium-air batteries is the crossover of molecular oxygen from the cathode to potassium anode. This leads to the formation of potassium superoxide on the anode surface and reduces the availability of metal that can participate in energy storage. Therefore, designing alternative anodes and membrane electrolytes can solve the technical challenges in battery safety and lifetime. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including post-docs, graduates and undergraduates, will receive experiences in technology innovation, translation and entrepreneurship through the proposed research activities, prototype development and commercialization efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Stars seem reluctant to form in galaxy dark matter halos.  This is a puzzle.  To help solve it, the team will study the stars in a vast array of dark matter halos.  They will use optical and near-infrared data to measure the mass of the stars in galaxies and also between the galaxies in groups and clusters.  The measurements will be used to test theories that claim to have solved the puzzle.  Undergraduates will be heavily involved in the research.  The PI and his undergraduates will host hands-on events for the public.  They will advertise the events at schools in Albany, New York that serve underrepresented groups.  The PI will develop learning activities for undergraduates and high-school students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will study the light from stars in dark matter halos, on the scales of galaxies, groups of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies.  Their goals are to (1) measure the relationship between stellar masses and halo masses; and (2) constrain the total baryon fraction in massive dark matter halos.</AbstractNarration>

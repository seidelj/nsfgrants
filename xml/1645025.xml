<AbstractNarration>This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award renews an exemplary REU site at the University of South Florida.   The site includes a strong research component combined with professional development opportunities for the participating undergraduate students from across the nation.  Students will have the opportunity to explore research topics related to ubiquitous sensing, which includes current topics such as fixed and mobile sensing networks, location-based services, participatory sensing, and human-centric sensing applications. Students will learn to use a variety of techniques including visualization and data processing techniques and algorithm development to visualize large amounts of data and track movements of people in real time. This site also will also explore operation of the site, including its research and professional development opportunities in a foreign country, Spain, to offer students a global perspective to computing and the impact of their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The is project is led by an outstanding team offering state-of-the art facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of problems related to ubiquitous sensing. Ubiquitous sensing is an area of current interest that is well-suited to undergraduate research productivity.   Students will learn how to use current tools and techniques to solve those problems that have direct impact on people, particularly in the area of health care. The students will participate in research and professional development activities all designed to achieve the goals of retaining and graduating undergraduate students in computer science and engineering, recruiting students from groups traditionally under-represented in computing fields, and increasing recruitment of students into graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The award will support travel for approximately 10 U.S. professors, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students to attend the 16th International Congress on Catalysis (ICC) to be held in Beijing China on July 3-8, 2016. The ICC Congress is held once every four years at rotating locations around the world, and is the premier worldwide conference covering research advances in all areas of catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysis is an enabling technology for a wide range of chemical and energy-related processes, as well as increasingly for processes aimed at environmental remediation, sustainable energy, and control of greenhouse gas emissions. Twenty-five to thirty per cent of all manufactured products involve at least one catalytic step. The 16th ICC will help to focus worldwide attention on the role of catalysis in ensuring a sustainable future. Strong U.S. participation will ensure that U.S. researchers will play a prominent role in defining the research agenda needed to address the most pressing commercial and societal needs required to maintain U.S. competitiveness and environmental stewardship in all areas of catalysis.</AbstractNarration>

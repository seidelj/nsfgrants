    <AbstractNarration>A workshop on geometry of groups will be held at Universidad de la Republica in Montevideo in April 2016. The workshop will bring together researchers from Uruguay, Europe and the United States. The workshop will foster international collaboration and aid in the dissemination of recent advances. The funding provided will be focused on the support of U.S.-based early career mathematicians who are in an especially strong position to benefit from exposure to recent advances and a broader mathematical community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will bring together researchers from the emerging research group in hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory and Lie groups in Uruguay with U.S.-based and European mathematicians in these fields. The workshop will include three minicourses and 10-12 research talks which will focus on important new results in these fields and the powerful interactions between these fields. One aim of the workshop is to instigate collaborations between researchers from these varied mathematical communities. Early career mathematicians will benefit from the opportunity to participate in a school on Hyperbolic Groups and their Representations, aimed at graduate students and those in postdoctoral positions, which will be held the preceding week in Piriapolis, Uruguay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: https://geometryandgroupsinmontevideo.wordpress.com/</AbstractNarration>

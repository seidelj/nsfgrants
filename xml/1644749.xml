    <AbstractNarration>Distributed and Event-based System Conference Student Travel Grant&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the student travel grant to the ACM International Conference on Distributed and Event-based Systems (DEBS) in Irvine, CA June 20-24, 2016 is to provide doctoral students a supportive scientific forum to engage in inter- and multi-disciplinary scholarship focusing on distributed and event-based systems. The Scholar Roundtable provides a forum for expert and peer critique of students' doctoral work with the goal of improving their dissertation. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the student travel award enables the 'cross-pollination' of students, researchers, developers, and users as they explore research ideas, evaluate maturing technologies, and develop novel applications using these technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Distributed and Event-based System Conference Student Travel Grant is to support doctoral students through constructive remarks and feedback on their interdisciplinary research from prominent researchers and through interaction with other students. Student participants from a broad range of disciplines will give short presentations of their work and receive constructive feedback from internationally respected experts in the areas of distributed and event-based systems. The expert panelists will also provide student participants with career guidance and mentoring through presentations and small group advising throughout the day. In addition, support for travel and registration will allow student participants the opportunity to see the conference and network with conference attendees.</AbstractNarration>

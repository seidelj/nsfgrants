    <AbstractNarration>The rapid developments in technology and the widespread use of mobile devices have led to an explosive amount of data whose complexity is such that it becomes very challenging to extract any useful information in a reasonable amount of time and resources. The data are complex in size, dimension, and structure. The technology for rapidly processing such massive amounts of data is still in its infancy. One of the main goals of this project is to take advantage of some recent mathematical advances to develop and implement fast algorithms for fitting data by smooth functions. This could have many practical applications, for example in the design of automated systems that guide airplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles through complex terrains avoiding obstacles of arbitrary shapes. The proposed research carries the hope of advancing obstacle avoidance algorithms -- fast algorithms that can plan an optimal path under various constraints. The project will open new research directions for students and researchers; and it also will enhance our understanding of mathematical theories such as harmonic analysis, differential geometry, partial differential equations, and nonlinear programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 5-year integrated research and education project focuses on solving variational problems with boundary and/or obstacle constraints on arbitrary subsets in Euclidean space. The approach that the PI proposes is unorthodox: Rather than seeking exact minimizers of energy functionals, the PI will look for functions that minimize the energy functionals up to universal constant multiples. In contrast to the conventional approach to solving variational problems, which involves the solution of a partial differential equation, the PI will construct the solutions directly. The ultimate goal is to develop a complete theory revolving around the belief that any variational problem that can be solved using PDE theory can also be dealt with using extension theory. The special problems the PI will focus on are the obstacle problem, which requires the minimizers to lie above a certain barrier; and the Plateau problem, which seeks a surface of least area with prescribed boundary. Solving variational problems using PDE methods often requires the boundary of the set to have some kind of smoothness. In practice, this is a severe limitation. The novelty of the proposed approach is that there is no need to make any assumption on the geometry or the regularity of the set on which the PI prescribes the boundary conditions or constraints.</AbstractNarration>

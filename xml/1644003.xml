    <AbstractNarration>Mount Mary University will initiate the Jewel Scholars Program (JSP) to support two overarching goals: (1) expand access to STEM careers for women and underrepresented students who have demonstrated financial need and academic talent, and (2) prepare skilled scientists whose unique, diverse perspectives contribute to the overall integrity of scientific advancement and innovation locally and nationally. Mount Mary University was founded by the School Sisters of Notre Dame to "educate women to transform the world," and enrolls a high percentage of low-income and minority students. Named after noted African American female cell biologist Jewel Plummer Cobb, JSP will provide academically talented, low-income female undergraduate students with the financial, academic, and practical support to succeed in biology, chemistry and food science chemistry majors, and ultimately in STEM careers. JSP will develop visual/spatial and research skills, a sense of belonging within academic and career settings, identification as a scientist, and professional skills through a scholars orientation, yearly 3-D molecular modeling research seminar, faculty mentoring, peer tutoring, and other comprehensive supports. JSP will prepare scholars to enter and meaningfully contribute to the STEM workforce. Mount Mary University will share best practices for engaging and supporting promising female scientists with academic and industry partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Mount Mary University Jewel Scholars Program will address Wisconsin employers' needs for a skilled, diverse STEM workforce by improving graduation and STEM career placement rates and expand evidence-based research through a study on whether experiential co-curricular 3-D molecular modeling research seminars increase visual/spatial, cognitive and hypothesis-creation abilities in STEM. JSP will support scholars' persistence, graduation, and workforce placement through: (1) comprehensive supports and cohort-building, (2) scientific knowledge, identity and skills development activities, and (3) supporting professional skills and workforce connections. Activities will include an annual scholars' orientation/retreat, faculty mentoring, peer tutoring in STEM foundation courses identified as attrition points, and a yearly inquiry-based 3D molecular modeling research seminar. JSP will connect scholars with local STEM employers in Water, Food and Beverage, and Energy sectors through the Milwaukee Regional Economic Development Partnership's (M7) Talent Initiative. Mount Mary University will expand the evidence base about undergraduate STEM learning by institutionalizing STEM-specific retention approaches that develop scholars' visual-spatial and problem-solving skills, and identities as scientists.</AbstractNarration>

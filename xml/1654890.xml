    <AbstractNarration>Women of color are underrepresented throughout the engineering professoriate. This project is developing a special professional development workshop for women faculty of color to broaden their participation in advanced manufacturing areas. The main objectives of the workshop are to: 1) increase awareness of innovation needs and relevance of advanced manufacturing to the U.S., 2) promote a networking platform that brings women of color engineering faculty together to stimulate potential collaborations on advanced manufacturing, and 3) share strategies for overcoming obstacles that often hinder the career advancement of women of color faculty in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research-driven workshop will focus on emerging advanced manufacturing areas, with an emphasis on the design of materials, additive manufacturing, and hybrid manufacturing. Workshop participants will have access to state of the art equipment available in the Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering Department at Iowa State University, and training will be offered through modular hands-on activities that are supplemented with theoretical instruction. The workshop will host up to twenty-five women of color engineering faculty from various universities around the country, along with ten to fifteen undergraduate students from Iowa State University. The participants will engage in a "speed mentoring" activity, where they will have the unique opportunity to develop and discuss their specific career plans in one-on-one sessions.</AbstractNarration>

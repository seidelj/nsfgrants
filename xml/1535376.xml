    <AbstractNarration>This award will help support student attendance at the 2015 Computational Complexity Conference (CCC) that will take place June 17th to June 19th, 2015 in Portland, Oregon, USA, as part of the Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC 2015). CCC is the premier annual conference devoted to research in computational complexity theory. The conference aims to foster research in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints, and the mathematical aspects with close connections to such a study. The conference will have approximately thirty high quality presentations in a single-track session over 3 days. The field of computational complexity is a vibrant one, with high participation rates from young researchers, and many papers with student authors. For these student authors and student attendees, the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will provide partial support to approximately ten students, partly defraying the cost of registration, travel, and lodging.  In selecting students for a travel allowance, efforts will be made to support students from under-represented groups and geographically diverse areas.</AbstractNarration>

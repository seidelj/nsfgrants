    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds to upgrade the capabilities of the Kraken2 (K2) Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) owned and operated by the University of Connecticut's Northeast Underwater Research, Technology and Education Center (NURTEC). The funding willbe used to transform the K2?s current configuration into a more efficient, flexible and capable "science class" ROV. Systems to be upgraded include: winch; ROV portable control components; HD camera; and, manipulator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although not a UNOLS facility, the K2 has been used support the installation, operation and maintenance of the Ocean Observatories Initiative?s Pioneer Array. K2 will also support the sea trials of the R/V Armstrong. It is expected that K2 will continue to support NSF science needs around the U.S. east coast continental shelf. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal broader impact of this award is relevant to Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vehicle in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of research support infrastructure allows NSF-funded scientists from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating tunable microwave interferometer technology to fill the need for online monitoring of yeast cells and early detection of microbial contamination in fermentation processes. The proposed microwave flow cytometer (µFC) is important because it provides essential information to optimize the fermentation process, improve production yield, monitor microbial contamination, and control product quality in various industries, including the bioethanol fuel, brewing and distilling industries. American companies in these industries support millions of jobs and produce several hundred billion dollars' worth of economic outputs annually. Improving productivity and reducing financial loss caused by microbial contaminations are critical for their continued prosperity and growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microwave flow cytometer has the following unique features: reagent free cell detection and identification, robust operation, and user friendly instrumentation. These features provide the following advantages: low cost operation, online counting of viable and nonviable yeast cells, and early detection of microbial contamination when compared to the leading competing technologies in the market space, such as optical density (OD) detection, radio-frequency biomass sensing, microscopy based cell counting, staining based viability evaluation, and chemical reaction based yeast activity monitoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration of microwave flow cytometer technology for accurately counting yeast cells (cells/mL) at high speed, determining yeast physiological state (viability and vitality), and identifying typical wild yeasts and bacteria in typical fermentation processes. A preliminary database of the microwave properties and signatures of these microorganisms will be obtained. This project will address the following knowledge and technology gaps: the microwave properties and signatures of typical fermentation yeasts and bacteria, the appropriate µFC frequencies for individual yeast cell and bacteria detection and differentiation, and the techniques for the design, fabrication and operation of microwave flow cytometers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduate and graduate students, will receive innovation experience through characterizing the microwave properties of yeast cells and identifying their signatures. The students will receive technology translation experience through developing user friendly microwave flow cytometer instruments. They will also receive entrepreneurship experience through close interactions with the industrial partners of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project engages Ferm Solutions and Wilderness Trail Distillery in Danville, KY to provide test environment and commercialization guidance in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>

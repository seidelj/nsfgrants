<AbstractNarration>Invasive plant species from East Asia are becoming increasingly abundant in North American forests, and often have negative impacts on forest function and biodiversity. Differences in how East Asian and North American plants acquire energy may explain the invasiveness of East Asian species. This project will examine differences in leaf traits driving energy capture in invasive species in their native (East Asia) and invasive ranges (North America). Seedlings of East Asian maple, cherry, and honeysuckle species growing in Aobayama Botanical Garden in Sendai, Japan will be used as focal individuals. A replicate study will be completed in Syracuse, NY using individuals sourced from North American populations. This project is a collaboration with Dr. Kouki Hikosaka, an accomplished ecophysiologist at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan. The results of this study will allow land managers to more efficiently minimize negative impacts of invasive species, an endeavor in which large amounts of resources and labor are invested annually.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant invaders native to East Asia are increasingly abundant in Eastern North American (ENA) forests. The goal of this project is to understand leaf-level physiological strategies used by shade tolerant, invasive woody species (representatives from maple, cherry, and honeysuckle species to maximize carbon assimilation at different light levels. Physiological comparisons will involve invasive and non-invasive species, as well as population-level variation in non-native species across their native and invasive ranges. This project will also quantify potential costs of being able to adjust leaf physiology to changes in light environments (i.e. from deep shade to high light after gap formation). Understanding the costs and benefits of physiological strategies at both the species and population levels will broaden our understanding of the mechanisms invaders use to outcompete native species. This project is a collaborative effort with Dr. Kouki Hikosaka at Tohoku University, a prominent leaf function expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

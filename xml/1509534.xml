    <AbstractNarration>Customers in cultural heritage institutions, both large and small facilities, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, hold thousands of silver objects under their care. The current method for corrosion protection includes the manual application of polymeric nitrocellulose, which protects objects for 10-20 years and can take 3 to 40 more hours per object depending on its size and complexity. The relatively short film lifetime and long application process leaves museums with thousands of silver objects in a constant cycle of replacing plastic coatings or leaving many objects unprotected. The proposed atomic layer deposited (ALD) coating developed by this I-Corps team is expected to fulfill the rigorous requirements required by cultural heritage institutions such as museums, archives and libraries, and fine silver jewelry manufacturers such as artisans or jewelry retailers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALD films will allow for the long term protection of cultural heritage objects, as they protect silver significantly longer than the current coating technology, applying nitrocellulose films. By reducing the amount of tarnishing and frequency of polishing, objects can be preserved longer without loss of original surface details. This I-Corps grant will allow ALD coating technology to be transferred to the cultural heritage and museum conservation community. As part of this technology transfer, the team will also develop a better understanding of how ALD metal oxide films affect the chemical structure and visual characteristics of the substrate. While ALD films applied to clean, flat, 2D surfaces is well understood, little work has been completed on the effect of using ALD films on rough, 3D objects with prior surface treatments. The knowledge and experience gained through the I-CORPS program will be shared with other potential entrepreneurs and students through a proposed seminar with the University of Maryland's Clark School of Engineering, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program, and Hinman CEOs program. This seminar would further disseminate the knowledge gained through I-CORPS to other entrepreneurially-minded students at the University of Maryland.</AbstractNarration>

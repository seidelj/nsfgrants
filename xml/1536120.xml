    <AbstractNarration>Microscopic phytoplankton generate about half the oxygen produced on the planet each year. Flow cytometers are essential oceanographic instruments that rapidly and accurately measure the abundance, size and fluorescent characteristics of individual phytoplankton cells. The goal of this project is to develop a miniaturized, low-power, continuous flow cytometer that operates underwater. The targeted deployment platform is a standard ship-deployed water sampler (CTD rosette), although design features will ultimately allow installation into a variety of other oceanographic underwater instruments. Named PipeCyte, this cytometer will continuously measure abundance, cell size and fluorescence characteristics of phytoplankton cells (0.5-20 Âµm) during the down- and up-casts of the CTD and will transmit data in real time to CTD operators. PipeCyte will radically alter the view of the lit portion of the ocean currently afforded with CTD-based measures of chlorophyll fluorescence ? in addition to chlorophyll fluorescence peaks, operators will see the abundance of different types of phytoplankton within the peaks. Development of underway instrumentation that maps microbial distributions in real time is essential for understanding biogeochemical and ecological processes in the ocean. The instrument proposed here will provide an unprecedented view of the relation between environmental features and phytoplankton communities in the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current underwater flow cytometer systems depend on a supply of clean water for instrument operation and are vulnerable to clogging and biofouling. PipeCyte relies upon an optical technology that enables direct cytometric measurements on a flow of raw seawater. The primary optic (lens) is immersed in a large diameter flow of the sample fluid, sidestepping the usual clogging and maintenance issues associated with the small orifices present in all flow cytometers. This immersed primary optic can be easily cleaned or replaced. The design is robust, compact, and will consume 15 watts or less while under full operation. The instrument is designed to require no more maintenance than a standard fluorometer. Instrument development will be divided into three phases. First, the current PipeCyte prototype will be iterated in two more prototypes to optimize the sensitivity of the optical system by differing focal lengths. Second, power reduction and miniaturization will be achieved by transitioning from current SeaFlow data acquisition and control electronics to a microcontroller-based system. This design path will dramatically reduce the power consumption and dimensions of the instrument so it can fit within the target volume. Finally, in-lab validation against a benchmark flow cytometer system will be performed, followed by field-testing at sea.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division funds Drs. Markus Ribbe and Yilin Hu from the University of California, Irvine to investigate the mechanism of carbon monoxide activation by a unique enzyme. The world is in need of sustainable supplies of carbon fuels while at the same time needs to address the accumulation of carbon wastes which result from the incomplete or complete combustion of carbon fuels. The ability of the enzyme to convert these carbon wastes back into hydrocarbon fuels under mild conditions may be an effective strategy to recycle them back into the usable fuel sources. Drs. Ribbe and Hu are studying how the enzyme may accomplish these goals. Additionally the multidisciplinary nature of the project and the wide varieties of techniques employed are providing abundant opportunities for the education and training of students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combined biochemical and spectroscopic approaches are being used to investigate the mechanism of CO activation and reduction by V-nitrogenase, with an emphasis on defining the complete product profile and the reaction pathway of this process. Knowledge acquired through this research is being used to provide mechanistic insights into the reaction of enzymatic CO conversion, enable engineering of nitrogenase-based hydrocarbon-producing microbes, and inform designs of novel CO-and CO2-reducing catalysts. Research and education is being integrated through the project by (i) training undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate researcher on the bench, where all individuals engage in joint efforts that enrich the proposed research through the diversity of learning perspectives, and where underrepresented groups of individuals are incorporated to further improve the diversity of the proposed activities; and (ii) organizing outreach events and designing relevant courses that focus on nitrogenase and related research, where students are introduced to the broad topic of global energy/environmental problems and potential biotechnological solutions to these problems, and where motivated students are recruited for the research activities.</AbstractNarration>

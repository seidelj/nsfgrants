    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: The ease of processing and mechanical flexibility of organic semiconductors drive the potential for their broad integration into disruptive technologies. Such materials, for example, are already being used in commercially-available curved television and smartphone screens. The research component of this CAREER award investigates nanometer-scale properties of individual organic semiconductor nanowires with controlled size, shape and composition, provides fundamental insight into the factors that influence the electrical properties of organic semiconductor nanowires, and serves to guide the development of next-generation electronics, sensing, and energy harvesting technologies. These research efforts are integrated with educational activities designed to stimulate interest in science among young Binghamton-area students and to improve the retention and training of Binghamton University science undergraduates. The educational initiatives support the science teaching efforts of school teachers and provide hands-on science activities for students from low-income and historically underrepresented minority populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The electrical properties of organic semiconductor nanowires have so far been predominantly assessed at the devices comprising large ensembles of nanowires, providing limited insight into the nanoscale origins of device performance. Moreover, systematic study of the relationships between organic semiconductor nanowire structure and electrical properties has been hindered by a lack of independent control over nanowire size, shape, and composition. The central research goal of this project is to elucidate the roles of organic semiconductor nanowire structure in mediating charge photogeneration and transport at the single nanowire and single interface level. The project examines the effects of nanometer-scale spatial confinement on the growth of organic semiconductors, the dependence of charge transport on internal nanowire structure and nanowire interfaces, and the influence of nanowire size and composition on charge photogeneration, recombination, and collection. Organic semiconductor nanowires of controlled size, shape, and composition are synthesized by using a templated growth process. Nanometer-scale resolution local electrical measurements are performed by conductive atomic force microscopy. These experiments provide insight into the intrinsic electrical performance limits of organic semiconductor nanowires and inform efforts to integrate these nanomaterials into low-cost and flexible electronics.</AbstractNarration>

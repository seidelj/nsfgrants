    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor T. Don Tilley and his research group in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, conducts fundamental studies of structure, bonding, and reactivity in new transition metal-main group complexes. In this project, new strategies for chemical conversions are being developed. These have applications in drug development, polymer and materials synthesis, and the large-scale production of value-added chemicals. Young scientists are being trained in the area of catalyst development. In addition, Professor Tilly and the students involved in this project participate in and lead outreach activities, such as the training of local high school students and presenting science demonstrations at a local middle school. Notably, a collaborative effort within the research group involves planning and presenting science lessons to grade school students. Group members travel to nearby elementary schools (at least two each month) and teach basic scientific principles, hoping to improve early STEM education and encourage budding scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on complexes with silylene ligands, LnM=SiRR'. This research is designed to provide an understanding of the mechanism and scope of a new type of hydrosilation reaction discovered in this program and guides the way to more challenging catalytic hydrosilations. In addition, this program investigates catalytic systems that utilize cost-effective, earth-abundant metals such as iron, cobalt and nickel. Efficient catalysis with first row metals is a pervasive theme attracting strong interest in the research and industrial catalysis communities, and it is therefore important to learn how such catalysts may operate.</AbstractNarration>

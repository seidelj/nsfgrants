    <AbstractNarration>The 74th Device Research Conference (DRC) has a University setting and will take place at the University of Delaware, Newark, DE from June 19 to 22, 2016. Topics to be addressed include biological devices, emerging Electronic device materials (graphene, MoS2), devices for energy scavenging power, memory, nanoscale applications, including Terahertz and spin-based approaches. The Conference seeks financial support to underrepresented minorities as invited speakers as well as students, It has a strong tradition of student involvement, with strong student attendance to its short courses, poster session and oral presentations. The DRC also has a tradition of offering discounted student registration fees, not only for general attendance but also for its short courses, in order to encourage student participation and attendance from additional students who are not presenting an abstract. Support will allow offering 50% discount for student registration to the general conference and the day-long short course "Device Fundamentals You Were Never Taught: Interpreting Your Device Data" held just prior to the beginning of the conference.</AbstractNarration>

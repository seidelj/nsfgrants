    <AbstractNarration>This project proposes to support two conferences in the subject known as topology. The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) Symposium on the Geometry and Topology of Manifolds is to be held June 29-July 7, 2015, at University of British Columbia and the Applied Topology and High-Dimensional Data Analysis conference is to be held August 17-28, 2015, at the University of Victoria. Topology studies the shape of objects and how they can be deformed. It plays a key role in a variety of disciplines in science and engineering. Top level international experts will come together to discuss recent developments and applications. This grant will enable young researchers and students from the United States to attend these meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIMS Symposium on Geometry and Topology of Manifolds has as its objective to bring together mathematicians working on a broad range of topics in this area, and provide an opportunity for researchers and graduate students to learn about new connections. The program will include a combination of expository and research talks, as well as time for informal contacts and exchanges of ideas. Some particular themes that we hope will be represented during this activity include geometric structures and analysis on manifolds (e.g., Ricci flow, Einstein metrics, special holonomy); geometric group theory and 3-manifolds; geometric topology (e.g., surgery theory, cobordism and stability of diffeomorphisms); smooth 4-manifolds and gauge theory; symplectic geometry and topology. The conference "Applied Topology and High-Dimensional Data Analysis" aims to bring together applied topologists and spatial statisticians to explain their research and develop interactions between them, as well as to expose students to this emerging interdisciplinary field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workshops' websites:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/150629-psgtm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/150817-athdda</AbstractNarration>

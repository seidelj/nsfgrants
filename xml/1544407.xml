    <AbstractNarration>Southeastern Lie Theory Workshops will be held October 9-11, 2015 at North Carolina State University and May 23-26, 2016 at the University of Virginia. These workshops are part of the annual Southeastern Lie Theory Workshop Series held at universities in the southeastern region of USA since 2009. The workshop series website is http://pi.math.virginia.edu/lieworkshops/. The aim of the workshop series is to bring together senior and junior researchers, as well as graduate students, in order to build cohesive research groups in various aspects of Lie theory; to stimulate and enhance research collaborations in Lie theory; and to infuse a strong tradition of research and education in the region. Each workshop is centered on a research theme and will feature one or two main speakers, giving two to three expository talks that will be accessible to graduate students and postdocs in the workshop's theme area. In addition, there will be four to six invited talks by other researchers and contributed talks by junior researchers and advanced graduate students. Considerable time will be devoted to informal discussions among participants in small groups to work on specific research problems led by invited team leaders chosen from among the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic, combinatorial and geometric Lie theory is a major area of mathematical research with important applications to many different areas of mathematics, physics, and computer science. Research in representation theory includes the study of quantized enveloping algebras, quantum function algebras, Kac-Moody Lie algebras, Hecke algebras, canonical bases and crystal bases, vertex operator algebras, Hall algebras, A-infinity algebras, quivers, cluster algebras, Hopf algebras, and Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier algebras. The research theme for the workshop at NCSU in 2015 will be "Algebraic and Combinatorial Representation Theory" and the research theme for the workshop at UVA in 2016 will be "Algebraic Groups, Quantum Groups and Geometry."</AbstractNarration>

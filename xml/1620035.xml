    <AbstractNarration>The proposal is for student travel support and participation in the IEEE Conference on Connected Health (CHASE 2016) in Washington, DC supportive scientific forum for students to engage in scholarship focusing on the multiple computing and engineering issues associated with the multidisciplinary field of connected health. The consortium provide a forum for expert and peer critique of students' doctoral work with the goal of improving their research. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the travel support brings together people who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in multidisciplinary research in fields involving connected health. The CHASE conference also exposes participant to different scientific disciplinary approaches and develops the next generation of scholars in connected health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal for student travel support and participation in the IEEE Conference on Connected Health (CHASE 2016) in Washington, DC is to support doctoral students through constructive remarks and feedback on their interdisciplinary research from prominent researchers and through interaction with other students. Student participants explore a broad range of digital heath information technology, such as body sensor networks and intelligent techniques, while at the same time connecting patient and caregivers seamlessly in the loop of the healthcare ecosystem. Students will give short presentations of their work and receive constructive feedback from internationally respected experts in connected health. The experts will also provide student participants with career guidance and mentoring through presentations and small group advising throughout the day. In addition, student participants will have the opportunity to see the conference and network with conference attendees.</AbstractNarration>

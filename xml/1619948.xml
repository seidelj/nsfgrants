    <AbstractNarration>1619948 (Mitsch). This is a grant in assistance for international travel for U.S. scientists and engineers, the preponderance of them being early career, to participate in the EcoSummit 2016 in Montpellier France on August 29-September 2, 2016. The goals are: 1. To support the participation of these scientists and engineers in two specific invitation-only special sessions: 2. To develop at least two special issues in international journal(s) related to the theme of EcoSummit 2016: Sustainability and engineering change; and 3. To attract young U.S. environmental scientists and engineers to an international dialogue on ecological engineering for landscape sustainability and climate variability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than half of the funded participants will be female and six of the funded participants will be from EPSCoR states. Participation by USA scientists and engineers in this event will provide a stimulus to their research programs on sustainability, ecological engineering, landscape management, and climate variability. Those from the USA who attended EcoSummit 2012 in Columbus US have related the incredible opportunity that these ecosummits provide and the international connections that they made for enhancing their research. U.S. scientific research in ecological engineering, watershed management, and mitigating and adapting to climate variability will be especially enhanced.</AbstractNarration>

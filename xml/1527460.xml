    <AbstractNarration>Towards enabling reliable computing and promoting technology trustworthiness, this project seeks to facilitate cost-effective realization of robust and trusted integrated circuits (ICs), with particular emphasis in the analog/RF domain. While manufactured ICs are subjected to extensive scrutiny in order to weed out defective or suspicious parts prior to their deployment, a variety of reasons such as silicon aging and adverse operational or environmental conditions might cause the performances of a previously healthy analog/RF IC to fail its design specifications. Similarly, field-activated triggers of hidden capabilities might cause a previously trusted analog/RF IC to exhibit malicious functionality. With analog/RF ICs now prevalent in most electronic systems, due to the rapid growth of wireless communications, sensor applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT), equipping them with robustness and trustworthiness evaluation mechanisms becomes paramount to the applications wherein they are deployed. The proposed research is complemented by educational and outreach activities, including development of a new educational module, by providing opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research in interdisciplinary projects spanning Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, as well as exposure of local community members to the topics of self-test, self-calibration, and post-deployment trust evaluation of analog/RF ICs through tutorials and seminars organized by the Texas Analog Center of Excellence (TxACE) at the University of Texas at Dallas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this project seeks to enhance post-deployment robustness and trustworthiness of analog/RF ICs by integrating machine learning-based on-die monitoring and calibration capabilities. The key focus of this project is the cost-effective integration of on-die learning capabilities, which can be trained to (i) determine whether an analog/RF IC complies with its specifications, (ii) calibrate its performances, and/or (iii) detect the activation of potentially malicious circuitry, based on simple measurements from on-chip sensors. Through design, fabrication and characterization of two different analog/RF ICs, this project seeks to demonstrate that on-die intelligence can be integrated to provide post-deployment self-test, calibration and trust evaluation capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

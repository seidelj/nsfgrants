    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to address the unmet needs of blind and visually impaired population in order to increased their mobility independence with the aid of an intelligent wearable electronic device, compatible with the white cane, in a simple and cost-effective manner. The outcome of this project will contribute to scientific and technological understanding of environmental sensing and process automation by developing an integrated system comprised of sensors and underlying algorithms capable of gathering, processing, and interpreting environmental data and communicating relevant information to the user. The envisioned product can potentially meet the needs of 2.1% of the U.S. population who are considered legally blind, as well as make further contribution to the field of robotics, artificial intelligence, and other assistive technologies wherein a better understanding of the environment is desired. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to create a state of the art wearable device for the visually impaired that will enhance their situational awareness through the use of multiple sensors and intelligent algorithms. The main research objective is to develop an intelligent wearable device that will provide ability to detect above ground obstacles and recognize various categories of objects. In spite of significant technological breakthroughs, leading to many product innovations, there is very little technological progress for the visually impaired despite increased population longevity and significant demand for products that promote independent living. The proposed project will address the needs of the visually impaired in an intuitive and automated manner.</AbstractNarration>

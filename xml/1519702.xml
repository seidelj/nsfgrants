    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes significant advances in societal goals on energy security, sustainability, low cost energy, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The convection battery is a systemic approach to improve the way normal (not flow) battery chemistries are used in large systems (&gt;2 kWh). This technology will make batteries lower cost and lower weight. Specific examples of how this technology can achieve these goals include: a) reducing the cost of a battery pack for an electric vehicle from $10,000 to $2,000, b) reducing the cost of using wind power by up to $0.05 per kWh, and c) lowering the cost of remote power system used on farms and regions without an electrical power grid. From a commercial perspective, the proposed technology will better enable several important industries such as wind power, electric vehicles, solar power, storage of grid electricity, and electrical power systems for remote locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes significant advances in societal goals on energy security, sustainability, low cost energy, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

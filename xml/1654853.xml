    <AbstractNarration>Salt marshes are among the most productive environments on earth and they are highly valued because they provide food and nursery habitat for numerous species of commercial importance, they improve water quality, they buffer buildings and other infrastructure against coastal storms, and they create new land and habitat for wildlife. This project builds on decades of research in North Inlet estuary in South Carolina on the productivity of salt marsh cord grass that have led to new insights about the regulation of marsh productivity and the feedbacks that maintain salt marshes in equilibrium with sea level. This research is important because sea level is rising at an accelerating rate and threatens to drown these ecosystems. This project will employ a combination of experiments and field observations to understand how increasing cord grass root growth impacts the elevation of the marsh surface as sea level rises. Fertilizer additions will be used to increase root growth and test the hypothesis that this will allow the marsh surface to rise. These manipulations to simulate changing marsh elevations will provide a direct test of how relative elevation affects plant growth. This research will further development of an important management tool, the Marsh Equilibrium Model, for coastal resource managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LTREB research at North Inlet has included monthly measurements on permanent plots of stem counts and heights of marsh cord grass (Spartina alterniflora) made since 1984 and supplemented by monthly measurements of porewater chemistry, snail density, and marsh surface elevation. A synthesis of these data has led to the development of a marsh equilibrium theory and the Marsh Equilibrium Model describing how feedbacks among plants, nutrients, tidal flooding, and sediments move a marsh toward an equilibrium with sea level. During the next five years this project will continue development of theory, continue collection of primary data, and conduct experimental manipulations to test the importance of plant roots and nutrients on marsh elevation. It is hypothesized that nutrient additions will increase the growth of roots and thereby raise the equilibrium marsh elevation. A resumption of nitrogen and phosphorus treatments in field plots, with before and after computed tomography scans of sediment cores, coupled with measurements of marsh surface elevation will test the effects of nutrients on the relative importance of belowground production and sediment trapping to vertical accretion. Bioassay experiments using marsh organs will directly test the productivity-elevation hypothesis and will be conducted in parallel with the field observations. The broader impacts of this project extend to the public through talks given about sea level rise and marshes to civic groups, discussions with policy makers, and participation in policy forums. Graduate student training and use of the long-term fertilization and census plots in the salt marsh at North Inlet by visiting scholars will be supported.</AbstractNarration>

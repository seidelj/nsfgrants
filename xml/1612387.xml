    <AbstractNarration>The University of West Florida Geoscience Scholars program will investigate the effect of a multidisciplinary research cohort on student success and pursuit of graduate studies and careers in STEM and the geosciences. Undergraduate research in the geosciences will be used as a mechanism for enhancing the perception of multidisciplinary collaborative research and as a focal point for the development of "soft" skills, such as verbal and written communication, critical to professional success. A research cohort model will be used. This model will be built around multidisciplinary research projects founded in the earth sciences and employing regular professional skills-development activities to encourage post-baccalaureate interest in the geosciences. Faculty mentors and research students from across the STEM disciplines will be engaged in the project, ensuring students will have opportunities to participate in undergraduate research in their chosen field of study, while also observing the application of their field of study to the geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will pilot and assess the impact of a multidisciplinary research cohort intended to increase the number of students prepared to enter the geoscience workforce or continue on to graduate programs in the geosciences. The project will contribute to the creation of knowledge related to the impact of multidisciplinary research cohorts on student success and engagement in STEM graduate studies and careers, both within the geosciences and in the broader STEM community. This project will research how multidisciplinary cohorts impact student success and retention, decisions to continue in a geoscience graduate program, and preparation for the workforce. A professional skills seminar course will be introduced to help students develop verbal and written communication skills.</AbstractNarration>

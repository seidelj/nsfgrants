    <AbstractNarration>A Research Experience for Undergraduates award has been made to the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) to support the participation of undergraduate students in BIO-funded REU Site and Supplement grants at scientific conferences. This award will also enable the PI to conduct outreach activities in order to make underrepresented minority students aware of opportunities to engage in REU research as well to present their research results to a broader audience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 150 undergraduate students each year for a period of 3 years will be supported on travel awards to conferences. Supporting student participation in scientific conferences will help create a STEM-capable workforce as students are able to network with their peers and meet future graduate program advisors and/or STEM employers. Preparation for a poster or oral presentation provides the student the opportunity to gain a deeper insight into the process of science and the significance of their work. Presenting results at a scientific conference is a capstone experience for many students, who can take advantage of the conference to explore related science topics, make connections for a possible career in science, and explore potential science career paths. .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages existing investments in the REU program to improve undergraduate research training as well as to diversify the STEM-capable workforce. Participation in a professional, scientific conference is an important new context for many students to engage in as part of the larger scientific community. It gives students an opportunity to see themselves as scientists. Self-identity as a scientist is a strong positive predictor of whether students continue in science.</AbstractNarration>

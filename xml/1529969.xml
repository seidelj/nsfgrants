    <AbstractNarration>Obesity rates continue to rise, despite increased funding for nutrition education and policies to encourage healthy choices. This project addresses the question of how to get consumers to make healthier food choices without asking them to work hard to do so. Finding answers to this question may be the key to reducing the obesity epidemic. The proposed research harnesses concepts from behavioral economics to make the healthy option the salient and easy choice. The filed experiments in this project offer an opportunity to study customers making decisions with real dietary consequences. The studies focus on consumption of French fries, soda, and desserts. The results can be extrapolated to other foods and applied to encouraging or discouraging a variety of dietary choices. From an economic standpoint, in addition to promoting health, the interventions could allow for-profit establishments to make more money by offering a smaller portion of a food item but still garner customer satisfaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to examine the role psychological processes (affective versus cognitive) play in making food choices. Using novel methodologies that include acquiring individual level data on customer transactions, the research will investigate interventions to nudge people toward making healthy food choices. The project entails two field studies, both to be conducted within the foodservice operation of a large public university. The two studies focus on manipulations to decrease portion sizes of indulgent foods by appealing to emotional (affective processing) or non-emotional (cognitive) motives. The aim of the first study is to compare a charity/pro-social motive (tapping a hypothesized emotional mechanism) to a nutrition/self-interest motive (tapping a hypothesized cognitive mechanism) in their effectiveness in nudging college students to downsize their French fry portion and/or accept fountain water instead of soda. The aim of the second study is to examine whether manipulating menu descriptions can impact satisfaction with food consumed. The researchers predict that a sensory-rich, detailed (emotional) description of a dessert can, in effect, substitute for size of the dessert, making diners just as satisfied with a small portion of dessert as they would with a larger portion of the same dessert, absent the decadent, emotionally-detailed description. Both studies will test the "emotion effect" in getting individuals to eat less while feeling virtuous and satisfied with smaller portions.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Replication and reproducibility are critically important tenets of the scientific process.  Yet, many fields including education research struggle to regularly support and publish results from replication studies.  Although important strides have been made to ensure that more scientific data is available, substantive challenges remain with respect to making data from important publications widely available in a timely manner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference proposal will bring together journal editors and early career researchers in education research to discuss issues related to open science including, replication, reproducibility, and data sharing related to the publication process. This 2-3 day conference that will help to develop a fuller understanding of the principles and purposes of journals in the data sharing process, consider the role of journals in publishing replication research, broaden knowledge about the mechanisms for sharing data and cultivating replication research,  and provide early career scholars with opportunities to play a critical role in replicating and reproducing research findings via open access to data.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>A motivated and diverse group of undergraduates will be recruited to work on research problems in a variety of topics in mathematics including geometry and analysis. The purpose of the program is to provide mathematics research experiences in a nurturing atmosphere for talented and motivated undergraduates. Students will work on projects arising naturally in the research of the Mathematics Department faculty. The student participants will learn how to discuss and present mathematical ideas, write project reports, explore with mathematical software, and engage in mathematical research. The emphasis of the program is on independent work under close supervision of a project advisor. The program will provide an intense research graduate school-like experience and lead students to awareness and appreciation for potential connections between different fields of mathematics. The program will be advertised nationally with a particular effort to reach underrepresented groups. The expectation is that many of the REU students will decide to pursue graduate studies in mathematics or related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most of the projects will require only a limited background, allowing the participants to get right to work extending their knowledge of the subject while working on research questions. This will also allow for the recruitment of well-prepared students at earlier stages of their studies, including freshmen and sophomores. Motivations for the projects will come from a variety of fields, including algebraic geometry, coding theory, convex geometry, group theory, harmonic analysis, lattice point geometry, Lie algebras, linear algebra, number theory, operator theory, and ring theory. All the projects will deal with unsolved research problems. Based on previous experience, the expectation is that many of the projects will lead to publications in refereed journals.</AbstractNarration>

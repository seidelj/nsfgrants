    <AbstractNarration>Green Ninja (GN) is a creator of educational curriculum surrounding the quirky adventures of The Green Ninja "a superhero" to teach science in a humorous, youth oriented way. This I-Corps team believes the longer a student is exposed to consistent messaging, the greater the impact over a lifetime, drawing from examples such as Smokey Bear?s "Only you can prevent forest fires," and Woodsy Owl "Give a hoot, don't pollute." The product has two components: First the proposed work provides extensive professional development for&lt;br/&gt;teachers to comfortably teach science within the parameters of the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), a recently imposed set of learning standards that both students and schools will be scored on. Second, the proposed work helps students see the value of science through engaging curriculum that helps them solve problems that matter to them and their community. The GN?s product aims to reduce the achievement gap in science and engineering fields among students from lower social-economical backgrounds through a dynamic curriculum that focuses on hands-on learning. We believe GN curriculum will ultimately increase long-term student engagement in the field of science, especially within underrepresented populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green Ninja is currently in the prototype phase. The team is working to create a new, disruptive method of conducting impactful professional development workshops, curriculum material and the IT platforms to sell the product at the district level. The product is currently being piloted at five different schools throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The team is working closely with each teacher using the material to understand the user experience and adjusting the focus where needed, based on teacher feedback. During the I-Corps program, the project plan is to meet with a minimum of 100 potential contacts to share the proposed Green Ninja product and to listen carefully to determine if the team is solving its (NGSS and science engagement) business problem.</AbstractNarration>

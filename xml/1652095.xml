    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical: &lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Tufts University is to study biologically produced, conductive protein nanowires as soft electronic probes to improve the bioelectrical signal recording from living cells and tissues. Conventional cellular recording platforms are based on metals or semiconductors, and these are often limited by compromised signal coupling and compatibility issues, largely due to the intrinsic mismatch of physical and chemical properties at biotic/abiotic interfaces. The proposed research aims to overcome this key limitation by designing and developing electronic materials that can be biologically assembled from nature's building blocks and thus inherently integrative to biological systems. This new biomaterial platform has the potential to be translated into a wide range of biomedical applications, such as prosthesis, cardiac repair/regeneration, brain-machine interfaces, etc. As part of this CAREER award, the PI plans to exploit biomaterials research as a tool to improve STEM learning and broaden STEM participation. The multi-disciplinary nature of the proposed project and the integration of research and educational activities make them particularly well-suited for educational purposes and training future scientists. A series of learning modules will be developed based on the proposed research project that will be used to enrich the curriculum of undergraduate courses, train and guide undergraduate and graduate researchers, and disseminate cutting-edge knowledge and experiences in biomaterials. The PI also plans to further broaden STEM participation by providing summer internship opportunities to underrepresented high-school students, stimulating their interest in STEM fields, and preparing them for success in higher education and STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: &lt;br/&gt;The optimal detection and interpretation of electrical signals generated by excitable cells represents a key to understanding, interrogating and directing many biologically significant processes. The proposed research aims to explore and investigate Bio-derived conductive protein Nanowires (BNWs) as a new category of nanoelectronic probes for minimally invasive cellular interfacing and signal transduction. Specific aims of this research are focusing on: 1) achieving controlled growth and assembly of biologically derived nano-wires with rationally designed properties; 2) defining the structure-function relationship and elucidating the fundamental charge transport mechanisms/limits at single BNW level; and 3) exploring the implication of BNWs in electrical cellular interfacing. By developing a nanoscale biomaterials platform that is mechanically compliant, electrically active, and biologically relevant, the proposed research is expected to fill the gap between living systems and artificial electronics to open up new knowledge base for both fundamental bioelectric studies and biomedical applications. The proposed research in developing a nano-scale biomaterials platform has the potential to overcome the current limitation in the compromised signal coupling and biocompatibility due to the intrinsic mismatch of the physical and chemical properties between the solid-state materials and biological systems. Additionally, these research efforts will be closely integrated with educational activities at both K-12 and college levels. A research-intensive educational program will be fostered, where the students will be exposed to the cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary research strategies and techniques. Underrepresented minority high school students from local communities will also be involved in these research efforts through summer internship programs to further broaden participation in STEM areas.</AbstractNarration>

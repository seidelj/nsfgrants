    <AbstractNarration>The Auxin 2016 meeting will be held October 20-25, 2016 in Haitang Bay, Sanya, China. The plant hormone auxin is an essential regulator of almost every aspect of plant growth and development. The auxin field is an active and rapidly developing area in plant biology and is increasingly relying on high level integration of diverse approaches with computational models and bioinformatics. Coupled with recent advances in synthetic biology there has been a resurgence of interest in broadening our understanding of auxin biology. The objective of this conference is to bring together a broad array of experts to enhance the international dialogue on critical issues relating to auxin biology. This conference will contribute to the enhancement and improvement of scientific and/or educational activities by bringing together a leading group of International and US researchers. Participation in this meeting provides a significant training experience for young career scientists who represent the future of science in the US. In addition, this meeting will provide the foundation for international collaborations between researchers in the US and elsewhere. The Auxin 2016 meeting will include oral presentations by invited speakers and from those selected from submitted abstracts, poster sessions, and lightning talks by junior investigators. The requested funds will be used to off-set registration costs for up to 30 US early career scientists and to provide funds for one junior faculty member who is an invited presenter. The organizers will prioritize support for underrepresented groups and women with NSF funds.</AbstractNarration>

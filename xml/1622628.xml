    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award will fund Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending the 15th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2016). The conference will be held on October 17-21, 2016 in Kobe, Japan. ISWC is the premier international forum for state-of-the-art research on all aspects of the Semantic Web - the next generation World Wide Web. The Student Fellowships will help cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible for them to attend the conference and discuss and disseminate their work. They will also provide an opportunity for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Semantic Web Conference, which is now in its fifteenth year, is an interdisciplinary conference that includes work on: Data Management, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Ontologies and Ontology Languages, Semantic Web Engineering, Linked Data, User Interfaces and Applications. It regularly has several hundred attendees. In addition to the main technical tracks, the conference includes a variety of events that provide opportunities for deeper interaction amongst researchers at different institutions, at different stages of their research careers, and researchers who are interested in many different aspects of Semantic Web Research. Students benefit from the Doctoral Consortium - a full day event where students can get critical, but encouraging, feedback on their work from senior members of the community. They also benefit from the career mentoring lunch, where experienced members of the community from both academia and industry answer questions in an informal setting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the conference web site at: http://iswc2016.semanticweb.org/</AbstractNarration>

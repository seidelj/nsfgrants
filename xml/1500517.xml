    <AbstractNarration>Abstract (Uhlmann, 1500517): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will support graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to participate in the Applied Inverse problems 2015 (AIP 2015), be held in Helsinki, Finland, May 25-29, 2015, as well as a summer school held also in Helsinki, May 19-22, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIP 2015 is one of a series of AIP Conferences aimed to provide a primary international forum for academic and industrial researchers working on all aspects of inverse problems, such as mathematical modelling, analytic and geometric methods, computational approaches, numerical algorithms etc. It will cover a broad spectrum of the applications of inverse problems, focusing on recent developments in medical imaging, determination of defects in materials homogenization and inverse problems, geometric inverse problems, remote sensing, industrial applications, numerical and regularization methods in inverse problems, and also, invisibility and cloaking. More information of the conference can be found at the website http://aip2015.fips.fi/. The NSF support from this award will allow a financial package for US students and postdocs to participate in the conference and the summer school, and will significantly enhance the ability to recruit an outstanding and diverse group of researchers to work in the area of inverse problems.</AbstractNarration>

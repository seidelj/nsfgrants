    <AbstractNarration>This project will examine three questions: (1) Is the risk of non-lethal criminal victimization among persons and households in the US significantly influenced by neighborhood immigrant concentration? (2) Is the likelihood of police notification among crime victims significantly influenced by neighborhood immigrant concentration? and (3) Do the effects of neighborhood immigrant concentration on victimization risk and police notification differ by individual race and ethnicity, and across counties that exhibit variability in immigration history, minority political incorporation, and the nature of policing? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions will be addressed by linking data on victimization and police notification from more than 600,000 household and 1 million person interviews from the 2007-2014 restricted-use NCVS to data from the American Community Survey and other sources. This project will advance understanding by: (1) offering the first nationwide analysis of the influence of neighborhood immigrant concentration on reporting crime to the police; (2) reevaluating the impact of neighborhood immigrant concentration on crime with data that include incidents both reported and unreported to the police; and (3) considering multiple measures of neighborhood immigrant concentration (the percentage foreign born, neighborhood spatial clustering or isolation of the foreign born, and foreign born concentration for Latinos and Asians).</AbstractNarration>

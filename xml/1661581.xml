    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project will include continued advancement in the fields of flexible electronics printing techniques, data visualization schemes specific to on-skin applications, and interactive modalities that go beyond the limitations of current mobile devices. The electrical and mechanical design guidelines specific to the devices subjected to high degrees of flex, stress, and strain will be highly applicable to the continuation of wearable technology in various forms. The project will also address effective data visualization techniques for wearable applications, which is crucial for users' ability to discern relevant information while inundated with an exponentially growing amount of data. The technical capabilities enabled by this project will ultimately allow users to interact with technology in a way that is seamless, natural, and intuitive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project will explore the market opportunities and potential customers for a thin, flexible, non-obtrusive on-skin interactive computing platform. By eliminating high cost cleanroom fabrication process and adapting proven techniques from the field of roll-to-roll flexible electronics manufacturing, this project will create an on-skin device that is priced for the consumer market for everyday use. Previous research activities have demonstrated that novel on-skin devices, which includes programmable LED displays, on-skin buttons for mobile device control, and a posture monitoring strain gauge, can be prototyped using a low-cost screen printing method. The technical development of these on-skin devices will continue to ensure their robustness and reliability for the appropriate commercial applications. The proposed activities will empirically identify the market segments and customers for which this NSF-funded research on-skin computing platform has the largest impact/benefit.</AbstractNarration>

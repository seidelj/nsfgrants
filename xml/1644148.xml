    <AbstractNarration>The "Strategic Undergraduate STEM Talent Acceleration Initiative" (SUSTAIN) project at Syracuse University will address the challenges of recruiting and retaining high-achieving, low-income students from diverse backgrounds into undergraduate STEM programs. The SUSTAIN program will award thirty $10,000 scholarships for up to two years, and will provide a coherent system of academic, social, and career support services strategically designed to enhance the success of biology and chemistry students during their first and second years of undergraduate study. Program goals include retaining at least 90% of the initial cohort of 30 scholars as intended or declared STEM majors following their freshman year, and to retain at least 80% of these students as declared STEM majors following their second year of participation in the SUSTAIN program. The program will establish a STEM faculty professional development workshop designed to foster the implementation of cutting-edge instructional practices that support dynamic, active learning approaches in introductory STEM courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholars will be provided 360 degree wrap-around support programming that is responsive to their evolving academic, social, and career development needs as they move through the freshman and sophomore years. Research efforts will investigate the socialization experiences of scholars throughout the program to examine the efficacy of the multi-faceted series of intervention supports to assess their impact on the future STEM trajectories of students. Findings from this project will promote the identification of promising approaches, identify areas for program refinement, and result in the development of a sustainable model for providing wraparound academic and social support services to STEM majors that can be replicated on other campuses.</AbstractNarration>

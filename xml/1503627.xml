    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop the necessary experimental and educational tools for the study, understanding and dissemination of the quantum dynamics of nanometer sized molecular magnets under a broad range of experimental conditions. The control of quantum properties of nanoscale materials has led to the appearance of new emerging technologies, such as quantum information and computation processes. Nanoscale molecular systems have great potential for ultra-high density integration and quantum information processing, which are technologies that base on the fundamental properties studied in this project. The proposed research is strongly integrated with a series of educational activities. Several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained at the interface between inorganic chemistry and fundamental and applied physics, and exposed to a large, interdisciplinary and international net of collaborations that the principal investigator has established over many years. In addition, the research supports an initiative led by the principal investigator to create new Minor and B.A. degrees in Nanoscale Science and Technology at UCF, which are built around three new nano-courses where the project's research will be showcased. The courses are offered as Service-Learning courses and designed to promote the early involvement in science of K-12 students in participating middle schools in the Orlando metropolitan area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to consolidate an integrated experimental and educational framework for the study, understanding, and dissemination of knowledge that details the magnetic properties of single-molecule magnets under a broad range of experimental conditions. The specific scientific goals are: a) to understand the role played by internal degrees of freedom in the quantum tunneling of magnetization in molecular nanomagnets, and, b) to study the nature of the light-matter interaction in SMMs in the weak and strong coupling regimes, with the goal of achieving quantum coherent control over the molecular spin in view of application in quantum information, molecular spintronics and related emerging technologies. The project goals base on an expansion of pulse EPR spectroscopy extending down to low temperatures (~100mK), achieved with the use of high-sensitivity microstrip resonators (including high quality factor superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators), is expected to enable measurements of decoherence rates with a sensitivity two orders of magnitude smaller than those attained in previous studies. Indeed, the experimental setup resulting from this project allows the investigation of the three primary sources of decoherence, e.g., dipolar, nuclear and vibronic. Diminishing and controlling sources of decoherence in molecular nanomagnets may enable the large number of gate operations demanded by quantum algorithms and quantum error correction protocols. In addition, their intrinsic magnetic molecular anisotropy makes molecular nanomagnets natural systems of interest for the emerging field of molecular spintronics. &lt;br/&gt;The research project is strongly integrated with a series of educational activities designed to train graduate and undergraduate students at the interface between inorganic chemistry and fundamental and applied physics, and exposed to a large, interdisciplinary and international net of collaborations that the PI has established over many years. The proposal strategizes plans to continue an involvement of underrepresented groups in research at all levels, as illustrated in a strong record of activities undertaken by the PI that promote diversity in the laboratory. In addition, the research supports an initiative led by the principal investigator to create new Minor and B.A. degrees in Nanoscale Science and Technology at UCF, which are built around three new nano-courses where the project?s research will be showcased. The courses are offered as Service-Learning courses and designed to promote the early involvement in science of K-12 students in participating middle schools in the Orlando metropolitan area.</AbstractNarration>

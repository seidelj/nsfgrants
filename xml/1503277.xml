    <AbstractNarration>This project will support the participation of 55 U.S. K-12 mathematics teachers or supervisors, graduate students, community college/university mathematics teachers, mathematicians, mathematics teacher educators and mathematics education researchers to attend the Thirteenth International Congress for Mathematical Education (ICME-13) to be held in Hamburg, Germany, July 24-31, 2016. The project will also prepare an educational status report (called the Fact Book) for the United States. The research team will report on the state of U.S. mathematics education in 2016, through a Fact Book that builds from those published for ICMEs 9, 10, 11, and 12.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through participation in the conference, American math educators will interact with mathematics educators from many countries and learn about their current math education practices concerning curriculum development, the use of technology in learning mathematics, strategies for reaching all students, teacher education and ongoing teacher professional development. The project is supported major national mathematics research and professional societies including the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, Association of Mathematics Teacher Educators, United States National Commission on Mathematical Instruction, Mathematical Association of America, American Mathematical Society and American Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges. Participants will disseminate information and resources from the conference through these mathematics organizations, math education journals, and social media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Discovery Research K-12 (DRK-12) program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models, and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This conference will advance the understanding of the U.S mathematics community regarding current international research and development in mathematics education, addressing the Teaching and Learning strands of the DRK-12 program.</AbstractNarration>

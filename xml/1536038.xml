    <AbstractNarration>The Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) is an annual topical meeting of the American Physical Society sponsored under the auspices of the Division of Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics. It is the leading international conference in the science and technology of Low Temperature Plasmas (LTP) combined with collision physics (CP). The GEC combines aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical physics with low-temperature plasma physics, electric discharges, and plasma chemistry, as well as their technological applications. Fundamental topics addressed at the GEC include atomic and molecular collision cross sections, plasma diagnostics, ion and electron distribution functions, as well as kinetic, particle-in-cell (PIC), and fluid plasma modeling. The conference has been the venue of the first presentations on world leading developments in investigations of LTP and CP topics including advanced combustion systems, lighting and lasers, plasma materials processing of relevance to the semiconductor and photovoltaics industry, and plasma application in biomedicine. The invited speakers represent the world's leading scientists in these fields. The future of any field depends upon attracting bright young people. The GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation, and has an enviable reputation of being the first conference where many of the leading members of the community presented their first research results as graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will pay partial travel support for 13 PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the 68th Annual GEC meeting to be held Monday, October 12 - Friday, October 16, 2015 in Honolulu, Hawaii. This will be a joint meeting with the International Conference on Reactive Plasmas normally held in Japan. Hawaii was chosen as the venue since it is located roughly in the middle between the US mainland and Japan. These two distinct meetings are expected to attract more than 600 plasma scientists, collision physicists, and engineers to the same convention center. This award will provide the opportunity for PhD students to establish peer to peer collaboration with researchers from around the world. The GEC, being a moderate size conference, presents an environment where collaborate research efforts and future endeavors are often initiated. The students will have the opportunity to observe first-hand the scientific and cultural diversity of the field, and establish what will hopefully be career long collaborations with their international counterparts. The GEC makes a special effort to support graduate students who are women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

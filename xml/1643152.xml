    <AbstractNarration>QCrypt, an international conference on quantum cryptography, will be held in Washington, DC on Sept. 12-16, 2016. QCrypt is the premier annual conference for students and researchers working on theoretical and applied aspects of quantum cryptography. Founded in 2010, QCrypt has been instrumental in building a research community in this area, which lies at the intersection of information theory, cryptography, and atomic/molecular/optical physics. QCrypt has a strong record of presenting some of the best quantum cryptography research in both theory and experiment, and it regularly attracts an audience of over 200 people from academia, industry, and government. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QCrypt seeks to increase student participation in the field. The proposed funding would support the travel of 10 - 20 eligible US students to the conference. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities, and institutions not traditionally represented at QCrypt.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Severe wind erosion and dust storms are a concern in the south central and southwestern parts of the United States. Prolonged drought conditions enhance the potential for Aeolian transport, where wind has the ability to transport and deposit materials such as sand and dirt. Advances in numerical modeling of the near-surface boundary layer of the atmosphere have made it possible to better connect the atmospheric and surface processes involved in Aeolian transport, in order to better understand how and when dust events will occur. The results of this study will be a step towards providing better information on which to make decisions regarding water resources and land use. The study will also include a variety of educational and outreach activities to connect the research to students and the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding for a study on the characteristics of neutrally and convectively stratified atmospheric boundary layer flows with a particular focus on flow over sparsely vegetated, semi-arid landscapes on the west Texas panhandle region of the Southern High Plains. The location of interest is known for severe wind erosion and dust storms, and the minimal topographic relief makes the region ideal for fundamental research studies with large-eddy simulation (LES) models. Modeling aspects of the proposal will be grounded by the use of field data courtesy of a collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture. Specific tasks will include: determining the potential to anchor low- and high-momentum regions in the flow using isolated obstacles, determining the role of solar heating in modifying the turbulence structure, and incorporating transport of suspended dust and inertial sediment into the LES code.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the nitrogen cycle at landscape, regional and global scales is a great challenge in environmental science. Humans have more than doubled the annual global production of "reactive" nitrogen, leading to degradation of air and water quality and coastal ecosystems in many areas. The most uncertain component of the nitrogen cycle is the flux of nitrogen gases, nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N2) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These gases are affected by multiple biological, chemical and physical factors and the fluxes are often highly variables and difficult to quantify. Addressing the challenge of nitrogen gases requires three key components; 1) measurement of all three gases (NO, N2O, N2) involved in the nitrogen cycle, 2) quantification of gas fluxes in and between key components of the environment; soil, water (including soil water, groundwater, streams, rivers, etc) and atmosphere and 3) evaluation of fluxes in a watershed/mass balance context. All of these components can be addressed with an integrated suite of instruments deployed in the field and laboratory in a coordinated manor, in context with other measurements. The Cary Institute leads nitrogen gas research at the Hubbard Brook and Baltimore Long Term Ecological (LTER) research sites. At these sites, long-term monitoring of nitrogen inputs and hydrologic outputs provide a strong platform for developing and testing hypotheses about the importance and controlling factors of gas fluxes. The instruments purchased with these funds will be used to improve and expand the long-term nitrogen gas monitoring at these two LTER sites. An additional major focus would be at the Cary Institute, which has a long-term environmental monitoring program and is an ideal testbed for comparison and evaluation of new approaches to measuring nitrogen gas fluxes. The Cary Institute has served as a nexus for nitrogen gas research and training for nearly 20 years. Numerous Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) participants, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from multiple institutions have conducted nitrogen gas studies in our laboratory. This new instrumentation will allow the institute to continue to play an important educational and network role in this critical, but highly specialized area of research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish the Cary Institute Nitrogen Gas Measurement Facility which will consist of an integrated suite of instruments that will allow for quantification of multiple gases (N2, N2O, NO), in multiple media (soil, water, atmosphere), in the mass balance context that is necessary for ecosystem, landscape and regional scale assessments. Key components of this suite include instruments to directly measure gas fluxes (including N2) from soil and sediment cores to the atmosphere, sensors for quantifying in situ fluxes of gases from soil to the atmosphere in both field chamber and eddy flux methods, and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to quantify dissolved N2 in water. There is immediate demand (and funding) for use and maintenance of the instrumentation for the ongoing long-term research at the Hubbard Brook and Baltimore LTER sites and the long-term environmental monitoring program at the Cary Institute. The Cary Institute nitrogen gas major measurement facility will be established under the supervision of Dr. Peter Groffman. The current lead research support specialist in Groffman's laboratory has over 10 years of experience in field and laboratory measurement of N gas fluxes and has trained numerous undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers. There is active collaboration among the senior research support specialists at the Cary Institute for allocation of space, training of new users and instrument maintenance and trouble-shooting. Much of this collaboration is managed by the institute-supported Director of Laboratory Facilities and Analytical Services, the Safety Officer and the Manager of the Cary Institute Environmental Monitoring program.

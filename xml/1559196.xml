    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is the geologic history of Po River Delta (Adriatic Sea). Due to changes in sea level that took place over the last 125 thousand years, the Adriatic Sea first contracted and then expanded. Consequently, Po Delta migrated offshore by almost 300 km and then retreated back to its current location. This project will examine how these long-term changes impacted the delta. Documenting how coastal zones responded to past climate shifts is important because coastlines are particularly sensitive to current environmental changes. In the case of Po Plain, its diverse marine life is already in decline and its agricultural wealth is under threat. The local historical cities such as Venice are at risk as well. By using Po Delta as a model example for coastal responses to environmental changes, the project will also serve as a platform for K-12 activities, public outreach, and undergraduate and post-graduate training. The project will result in a public exhibit at the Florida Museum of Natural History and foster international partnership between University of Florida and University of Bologna.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A total of 112 sediment cores drilled under the Adriatic Sea will be used to reconstruct the geologic and ecologic history of Po Delta. The core sediment data will be used to describe the internal architecture of the delta. The cores should also produce ~1000 samples of marine fossils. In addition, geochemical methods will be employed to numerically date 400 mollusk specimens. Multivariate analyses and computer models will be applied to explore the resulting data. These analyses will allow for testing hypotheses regarding the development of river deltas under different climate regimes and long-term responses of marine ecosystems to environmental changes.</AbstractNarration>

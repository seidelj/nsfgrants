    <AbstractNarration>Investment in campus cyberinfrastructure (CI) is essential to answering many of the most fundamental questions in science and engineering. Syracuse University has created a campus CI engineer position to provide the technical expertise and leadership to realize the potential of existing investments in CI and to guide strategy for future investments for research and education. Science drivers for the campus CI engineer come from a diverse range of projects including, gravitational-wave astronomy, biological physics, theoretical condensed matter physics, computational fluid dynamics, high-energy physics, Earth sciences, soft matter physics, and biomedical and chemical engineering. By allowing Syracuse researchers to better use CI, including research computing clouds, identity management services, networking, high-throughput computing, and high-performance computing, both on and off campus, the CI engineer allows Syracuse University researchers to advance scientific discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Syracuse University's campus cyberinfrastructure serves as an important resource for education of undergraduate and graduate students. An essential part of the CI engineer's responsibilities is lowering the barriers to access to CI resources for beginning researchers. The CI engineer's activities extend beyond engagement with the Syracuse campus, leading Syracuse University's engagement with the national cyberinfrastructure community, and collaborating broadly across campuses on shared goals.</AbstractNarration>

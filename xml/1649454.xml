<AbstractNarration>This award will partially support the 2016 IEEE International Workshop on Complex Systems and Networks (IWCSN-2016) in Atlanta, Georgia, October 13-14, 2016. This is an annual workshop for researchers in the emerging area of complex systems and networks, including biomedical and mechanical systems, robotics and control along with other applications in biological and engineering systems. The requested funds will support the participation of invited speakers that are selected from a broad community of researchers, as well as students/postdocs. The workshop covers a broad set of topics with underlying commonalities in terms of analysis techniques and mathematical tools, which are of interest to the engineering and applied mathematics communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the workshop are to provide opportunities for participants to learn about state-of-the-art research on various related yet disparate fields. The PIs and workshop organizers are planning tutorial talks and in-depth technical talks describing the latest research results and ongoing projects in related areas. Topics of interest of the workshop include, but are not limited to, complex networks, networked control systems, multi-agent systems, and synchronization phenomena in networks. These topics find applications in communication networks, power grids, electronic circuits, nano-material, biomedical systems, biological networks, neural networks, and disease transmission. The workshop provides a proper framework for interaction and interdisciplinary collaboration, which is key to scientific advancement in the diverse field of complex systems.</AbstractNarration>

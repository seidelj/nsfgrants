    <AbstractNarration>Clinicians and researchers routinely use single molecule experiments and plate reader based assays to determine the concentration or behavior of a molecule or substance of interest. Currently, researchers utilize signal enhancing substrates and expensive imaging systems such as total internal reflection microscopes (TIR) to obtain better image quality and lower detection limits. Clinicians perform patient diagnostics using diagnostic and test kits which utilize emerging technologies to provide kits with lower detection limits and faster assay times. Typically, these assays require well-trained technicians, expensive equipment and good infrastructure in which to operate. This I-Corps team is developing a platform that can be adapted to the currently used equipment and provide much better performance by enhancing fluorescence signals. This high performance platform is expected to reduce the burden of infrastructure and expensive equipment significantly by eventually being integrated into smartphones to create a point-of-care system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasmonic gratings greatly enhance fluorescent signal due to interaction of plasmons and fluorophores. The inexpensive fabrication method of the gratings take advantage of commercially available master molds in the form of CDs, DVDs, and HD-DVDs. Due to the fluorescence enhancement, low detection limit and high signal-to-noise have been achieved. This team envisions three products, slides printed with gratings, microwell plates, and platforms integrated with a smartphone. The I-Corps grant will provide valuable information and training about what is needed to bring this plasmonic grating technology to industrial and clinical markets. During the project, the team will have better understanding of market needs leading to better product designs. The knowledge and experience gained through I-Corps program will be shared with other potential entrepreneurs and students through meetings and presentations. These activities would spread the knowledge and experience to other potential entrepreneur leaders at the University of Missouri as well as surrounding communities.</AbstractNarration>

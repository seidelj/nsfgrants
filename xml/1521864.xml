    <AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for 29th European Conference on Object Oriented Programming (ECOOP) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support student travel to the 29th European Conference on Object Oriented Programming (ECOOP). The conference will be held in Prague, Czech Republic, in July 2015. ECOOP is the premier conference in object-oriented programming languages and software engineering. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The award prioritizes broad student participation, paying special attention to the selection of women and underrepresented minorities. Thus the broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in the area of object oriented programming and software engineering, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. Apart from the conference itself, several satellite workshops feature lectures from an impressive array of experts. Thus students have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies and novel techniques, and to interact with senior researchers who are leading researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>

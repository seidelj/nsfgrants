    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites Program in the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Professors Mitchell, Linenberger, and colleagues of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Kennesaw State University (KSU) reach out to 2-year and smaller 4-year partner institutions to recruit undergraduate students from institutions that typically do not have the resources to provide a research experience to their chemistry or biochemistry students. The targeted institutions also enroll a diverse population of students. The student researchers work in the lab one-on-one with faculty research mentors and other students on projects designed to be accessible to the undergraduates. The broader impact of the project is to expose a diverse pool of talented students, who have had limited exposure to scientific research, to the excitement of how science is done - working on projects that contribute to the understanding of important problems. All of the students are encouraged to consider a career in science. Society benefits from citizens who are more aware of the process of science and the benefits of scientific research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer research experience at KSU offers the undergraduate research participants (URPs) the opportunity to participate in research that encompasses a broad range of study in chemistry including biochemistry, analytical chemistry, chemical education, inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and physical chemistry. The URPs participate in weekly group meetings with their research mentor and his/her other research students, in workshops on topics ranging from laboratory safety to career opportunities. They also participate in an end-of-the-summer research symposium and in social activities designed to help them assimilate into their research groups. They form an initial network of colleagues and scientific associates that can help them in their future careers.</AbstractNarration>

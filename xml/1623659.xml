    <AbstractNarration>CBET-1623659, Mueller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiences in attending technical conferences are extremely beneficial to students. These experiences will not only help with the students' professional development, but also stimulate their critical thinking in formulating future research directions. This award is to partially support the travel expenses of graduate and undergraduate students in attending the 2016 Spring Technical Meeting of the Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute. This conference is one of the most important regional conferences on combustion science and engineering. Presentations in this conference represent the most updated research outcome in combustion. The conference facilitates the exchange of combustion research results through plenary lectures and oral presentations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to its effect on energy conversion, environmental quality, and climate effects, understanding of combustion processes and practical combustion systems is of paramount importance to society. Exchange of information at conferences increases the rate at which research breakthroughs can be made to make combustion more efficient and cleaner with fuel-flexibility. A particular focus of this conference is on graduate and undergraduate students: providing an opportunity for these students to present and get feedback on their research and running a workshop that enhances their "soft skills" such as oral presentation and technical writing skills. This award will be used to offset the travel expenses of non-local students in an effort to increase student participation at the meeting, particularly students from underrepresented institutions that may not have the financial means to fully support student travel to conferences.</AbstractNarration>

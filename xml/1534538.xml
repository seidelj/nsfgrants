    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this award is to broaden the audience attending the premier conference in communications, the IEEE Communications Society Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON), and as a result, raise the level of interaction and the potential for new collaborations, new investigations, and higher quality research. Support from the National Science Foundation is provided through this award for graduate students attending institutions in the United States. IEEE SECON publishes top-tier research on sensor networks and the Internet of Things, and is one of the top four conferences in this space. Since 2013, the conference has refined its scope to focus almost exclusively on sensors, sensor networks and their applications, with its large and varied application domains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students (especially those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from attending research presentations that may be related to their research areas. The research community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and from the introduction of new researcher perspectives. Additionally, everybody benefits from increased diversity of participants attending the conference.</AbstractNarration>

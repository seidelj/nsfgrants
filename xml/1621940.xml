<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase 1 project will improve motivation, learning and self-esteem of children by incorporating well-established principles from behavioral psychology and gaming science.  The innovation disrupts conventional paradigms by advantageously leveraging the exploding screen time trends of digital games and social media, which are commonly a nemesis to learning and attention span.  Children's interactions with this system will provide insights into their ability to delay gratification, a skill that is critically linked to many positive societal and life outcomes.  Initially, the innovation will address a critical need to offer a personalized approach to accelerate compliance with Common Core Standards (Common Core) related to math fluency and mastery. Once the premise is validated, the new system will be used with the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder population to improve attention span and reduce impulsivity. Ultimately, the platform will integrate with existing learning management systems administered by schools so a variety of subjects including STEM and Common Core can be featured.  This combination will create a revolutionary education platform that is delivered through smart devices, so different types of learning can occur at home, school or on the go, thereby, making state-of-the art learning technologies readily available to diverse social economic groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical innovation is a tablet and smartphone-based learning system that uses a neuro-cognitive model of a child's mental state to determine the optimal parameters to maximize learning as well as boost attention span.   Underlying the patent-pending platform are adaptive algorithms that merge established behavioral training principles including those from Precision Teaching and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder treatments together with the latest trends in gaming science.  Concurrently, the innovation will create behavioral and reward mechanisms intended to increase the level of dopamine, a key neurotransmitter in both the learning and reward systems.  Tangentially, the innovation will accelerate important neurological pathways that can free up working memory and improve self-esteem. A paramount outcome is to create a comprehensive software exchange that can be delivered through all types of smart devices.  The project goal involves writing new software and algorithms, leveraging established software and evaluating the software and algorithms with controlled experiments. The technical hurdles to be addressed include: 1) creating new algorithms for an adaptive math-fact curriculum that improve math skills and attention span, 2) enhancing existing data stack with state-of-art machine learning that maintains higher learning performance and motivation, and 3) demonstrating consistent trends in classroom, tutoring and home settings.</AbstractNarration>

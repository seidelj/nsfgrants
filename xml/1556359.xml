    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to the State University of New York at Buffalo to develop an instrument to measure the internal vibrations of proteins. Proteins are large molecules with thousands of atoms and perform most cellular functions. Proteins consist of long chains of amino acids, and these chains fold into specific structures. In general, proteins must alter their shape in order to perform their biological function. For example, Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen, changes shape in order for oxygen to bind. The internal vibrations of the protein structure that enable this change in shape are critical for understanding protein function. Recently a method has been devised to measure protein internal vibrations, called crystal anisotropic terahertz microscopy (CATM). The instrumentation and protocol development in this project makes CATM accessible to non-specialists, and enables broad application of the technique. The development of this instrument leads to the interdisciplinary education of two graduate students and two undergraduates. Integrated with the instrument development are educational and outreach activities that include an undergraduate seminar course and a week-long summer program for 7-12th grade inner city students from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to produce a compact turn-key spectroscopic system for the routine characterization of intramolecular vibrations of proteins. The technique called crystal anisotropic terahertz (THz) spectroscopy (CATM) uniquely measures these motions. Auto-CATM provides non-experts with the ability to quickly and easily categorize and classify biomacromolecules. The mini-system from Zomega Terahertz Corp. is the starting platform for the final instrument. A proof-of-concept database, and molecular modeling and data visualization software toolbox facilitate the development this new instrument. This instrument provides insights into how intramolecular vibrations are impacted by frequently modified parameters such as binding state and temperature. The technology developed for Auto-CATM also enable new rapid measurements for both bulk and micron scale materials and thus impact solid state physics and materials science.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduates Site Program, Integration of Biology and Materials in Chemical Engineering, at Penn State University aims to engage undergraduate students in a stimulating summer research experience with a dual focus on life sciences and materials. Research integrating biology and materials will contribute to advancements in the fields of medicine, environmental remediation, energy, and homeland security. Research interfacing materials and the life sciences will enable the development of specialized materials and processes aimed to meet critical national needs such as clean water, energy, and healthcare. The research, educational, and career mentorship provided by the program is intended to inspire the students to pursue careers in academic research or industrial innovation. Social activities as well as the use of pairing of students to work on joint projects will promote collaboration and teamwork amongst the students. Recruitment to the program will target students from institutions where research opportunities are limited and will focus on creating diverse communities during each REU session. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site is hosted by the Chemical Engineering Department at Penn State University. Undergraduate students selected from institutions across the nation will conduct ten weeks of academic research bridging materials and the life sciences. Undergraduate students will work collaboratively with another undergraduate student and with a graduate student mentor on a project sponsored by two faculty mentors. Technical activities will increase student awareness of careers and graduate school and will enhance students' analytical, collaboration, and communication skills. Mentorship training will increase the leadership skills of graduate students. Thus, the program will train the next generation of scientists and engineers to contribute to the nation's scientific output and to advancements in healthcare, energy, environmental remediation and security.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project employs a beam of low energy positrons (anti-matter of electrons) to provide unique information about novel nano-dimensioned materials including Graphene and nano-porous gold. When positrons annihilate with electrons both the positron and the electron disappear and the mass of the two particles is converted completely into energy in the form of gamma rays. The sudden removal of the electron from an atom can result in a highly excited state and the emission of electrons called Auger electrons. The energy of the annihilation induced gamma rays and Auger electrons provide chemical information about the atoms with whose electrons the positron annihilates. Previous NSF funded research by the investigators has shown that low energy positrons can be used to selectively probe the properties of the top layer of atoms at the surface due to the high probability of a low energy position becoming trapped at the surfaces of materials at the time of annihilation. The research in this project is aimed at exploring the use of positron spectroscopy to probe two dimensional materials like graphene. These materials are extremely thin. The ability to probe the topmost atomic layers of these materials provides a unique, non-destructive method for studying these materials in order to understand the mechanisms by which adsorbed atoms can be used to change important chemical and physical properties of these materials. Another important goal of the project is to determine the feasibility of using gamma rays from positrons annihilating at the internal surfaces of nanometer sized pores inside a novel class of materials called nanoporous metals to provide the information needed to understand the reason why these materials can greatly speed up desirable chemical reactions. The penetrating nature of the gamma rays permits measurement to be made on internal surfaces. The outcome of the activity will ultimately enhance the usage of low energy positron beam based spectroscopic techniques for research in chemical and biological sciences as well as in engineering. The project provides training to graduate and undergraduate students in fields of great relevance to high tech industry surface science, including low dimensional physics, ultra high vacuum technology, charged particle beams, radiation detection, nanostructure synthesis, material characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Low energy positrons are extremely sensitive to material surfaces due to a high probability that they will become trapped in an image potential state at the time of annihilation. The research in this project is aimed at understanding the interaction of low energy positrons (~ 1eV) with two dimensional materials including graphene/graphene oxide sheets. The trapping of positrons on two dimensional materials will be investigated using Auger like process called Auger mediated sticking as well as through positron annihilation induced Auger electron emission and Positronium formation. Measurements of positron sticking probability to graphene and graphene oxide surfaces are aimed at providing information on the contrasting surface properties of these materials and demonstrate the feasibility of using low energy positrons as a multi-parameter spectroscopic technique for two dimensional structures. Low background emission of electrons from graphene is expected to throw light on the physical origin of low energy electron tail seen in Auger emission produced by positron annihilation. A second major goal of this project is to explore the ability of using Doppler broadening gamma spectroscopy to probe the internal surfaces of nano-porous metals. The high probability that positrons will become trapped at the internal surfaces combined with the ability of gamma rays to escape from the internal surfaces indicate that positrons can be used to characterize the internal surfaces of the pores. These studies are aimed at using the unique information obtained from positron spectroscopy to understand the interaction of gases with the strained internal surfaces of nanoporous metals. These studies will allow for better control of catalytic activity of these novel materials as well as contribute to the development of high density hydrogen storage materials using nanoporous metals. The project represents the first exploration of the use of positron beams for the investigation of functionalized graphene, graphene oxide sheets and nanoporous metals.</AbstractNarration>

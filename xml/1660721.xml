<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the Preparing Secondary Teachers of Mathematics and Science in Rural Districts project will recruit undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, earth science, mathematics, and physics and prepare them to become secondary science and mathematics teachers. This Track 1 project will fund 34 scholarships over 5 years. In this project, Morehead State University (MSU) will collaborate with Carter, Fleming, and Rowan County School Districts in Kentucky and the Bronx, New York New World High School. The project is designed to increase the number of undergraduate STEM majors becoming highly effective secondary STEM teachers in the high-need districts of rural Eastern Kentucky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MSU Noyce Scholars will engage in the rigorous MSUTeach curriculum, replicating the successful UTeach model. Scholars will collaborate with secondary teachers and MSU faculty on designing and implementing a cross-cultural STEM Speaker Series for high school students. Select Noyce Scholars will participate in a one week onsite clinical experience with students, faculty, and staff of the New World High School.  Beyond financial assistance, MSU Noyce Scholars will benefit from 1) the collegiality and educative effects of participating in a Noyce cohort, 2) participation in cross-cultural experiences to develop knowledge of economic and cultural challenges related to STEM development in high-need areas, and 3) the opportunity to become a leader in larger regional STEM initiatives.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The broader commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the early detection of aspergillosis, a severe fungal infection that most frequently involves the lungs in immune compromised individuals, typically as a result of cancer chemotherapy or transplantation. The disease is often misdiagnosed resulting in poor patient outcomes and death. Early detection is important to initiate therapy and save lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project has two objectives: 1. To reconfigure a non-competitive immunoassay lateral flow device and 2. To develop novel antibodies that will result in feasibility studies of a point of care device for the detection of Asgergillus in urine. Successful completion of this project will result in a Phase II project toward commercialization.</AbstractNarration>

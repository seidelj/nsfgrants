<AbstractNarration>1638492-Wei&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF has made an award in support of travel and registration fees for undergraduate students, graduate students, post-docs, and under-represented, female and junior faculty to attend and present at the symposium on "Biomaterials for Tissue Regeneration" at the Fall Materials Research Society (MRS) national meeting in Boston, MA, November 28-30, 2016. The symposium will address recent advances in the development of biomaterials used for regenerative medicine.  Topics to be addressed include: 1) delivery of bioagents to promote tissue regeneration; 2) biomaterials as cell delivery vehicles; 3) biomaterials as tissue engineering scaffolds; 4) biomaterials to modulate immune responses; 5) evaluation of biomaterials for in vivo applications; 6) biomaterial design to influence cell interactions; 7) high throughput biomaterial screening and testing for regenerative medicine; 8) novel imaging techniques for studies of biomaterial-cell interactions; and 9) commercialization of biomaterials for regenerative medicine. Though in depth discussions will consider tissue engineering scaffolds, stem cells, and growth factors, the focus will be on scaffolds and improving scaffold design and development and their in vitro and in vivo performance.  Broader impact will be achieved with a larger attendance by graduate students, postdoc researchers, and junior faculty, especially from the under-represented groups made possible by the availability of NSF funding.  The organizing committee will select high-quality student and post-doctoral contributions during abstract review.</AbstractNarration>

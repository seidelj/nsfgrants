    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award is for the acquisition of a UltraHigh Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (UHR/SEM) for determining the structure and chemistry of materials at the nanoscale to advance the research of over 50 faculty, students and scientists at the University of Cincinnati (UC) and the region. This instrument will strengthen and advance multiple research areas and education of post-docs and graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art nanoscale characterization techniques, strengthen outreach programs and provide new opportunities for students and underrepresented groups, in line with the mission of the UC. Many other faculty and students at other local universities (Miami University, Ohio State University, etc.), and researchers in industry and government labs, will also benefit by having access to this instrument. Research, innovation, discoveries and education with the instrument will advance the science of materials and devices and factors governing their reliability; it will lead to new materials and products with unique properties and performance and new strategies for materials/device/product design; aid scientists in industry and government labs in the development and implementation of advanced materials and devices; foster new users, collaborations and strategic research involving academia and industry; and ultimately lead to expertly trained scientists highly qualified for advanced careers in engineering materials and devices in various sectors to enhance our nation?s global competitiveness. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;The new UHR/SEM, with appropriate ancillary devices for bulk and thin foil samples, will be installed and managed within the Advanced Materials Characterization Center (AMCC) at the University of Cincinnati (UC) and will be utilized to study a broad range of multidisciplinary problems in semiconductor nanowires; catalysis; structural materials; nanotechnology and biosensors relating to the structure, chemistry and phenomena of matter at the nanoscale and thereby advance in a transformative way the mechanism-based understanding of synthesis-processing-structure-property-reliability relationships of advanced materials and devices. Research using this instrument will enable insight into the structural implications of semiconductor nanowires for solar cell performance, probe the fundamental mechanisms that govern, limit and enhance reliability of high temperature structural materials, advance understanding of carbon nanotube and graphene devices and sensors, and illuminate the role of functionalized metallic, magnetic and photon upconverting nanoparticles in biosensors, photodynamic therapy and antibacterial agents and of the structure and surface chemistry of catalytic metallic/oxide nanoparticles.</AbstractNarration>

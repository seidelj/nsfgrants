    <AbstractNarration>Continuing a close cooperation between the Rochester Institute of Technology Center for Detectors and Raytheon Vision Systems, the PI will develop new infrared array detectors technology. They plan to reduce the number of material defects (which is the major remaining barrier to using these devices in low light level applications required for astronomical instruments). If successful, this will enhance the capabilities of infrared instrumentation in astronomy by dramatically reducing cost, allowing for larger detectors, and potentially improving performance when compared to what is available with existing technology. Beyond the astronomical community, this project could have positive impact on US technological competitiveness. The PI will actively involve undergraduate and graduate students in all phases of this program at the interface of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his team will continue development of a new material system for use in astronomical infrared array detectors. The devices use HgCdTe grown on Silicon using Molecular Beam Epitaxy. Preliminary results indicate that the technology will be successful for astronomy requirements pending further development. In this second phase, a series of devices with improved design will be manufactured and tested. The approach is to reduce the number of material defects while maintaining high short-wavelength quantum efficiency. The proposed work includes: growth of new material using a thick buffer layer design, fabrication of twelve focal plane arrays in two designs, and extensive testing between the fabrication of the two designs. This should enhance the capabilities of infrared instrumentation in astronomy by reducing cost and potentially improving performance when compared to what is available with existing technology. The proposed plan features a tight connection between design at Raytheon Vision Systems and testing in the Center for Detectors at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</AbstractNarration>

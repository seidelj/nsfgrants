    <AbstractNarration>With ever increasing frequency, cell biology researchers are finding the value in predictive computational modeling. Such an approach is a significant step in identifying and confirming the rules that govern life. A current limitation in this approach is a lack of training in the necessary methodology. The purpose of the proposed workshop/conferences is to bring together researchers who seek training in computational methods with those researchers that have this expertise. The expected outcome of this work will be to increase the number of cell biological researchers who have expertise in computational methods and who can, in turn, further increase the number of laboratories in the country who are familiar with these modern computational methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effort will involve a sequence of workshops that are designed to provide training in computational modeling methods to novices. Prior to the first meeting the participants will be asked to prepare for the meeting, both in preparing short statement of their own modeling interests, along with reading selected papers. During the first workshops, the novices will be paired with experienced modelers who will help develop a collaborative workplan for the following year. In subsequent meeting in years 2 and 3, the teams will come together and present their results and obtain feedback from the group, which will guide further computational work on their respective projects. The expected outcome will be the development of productive collaborations along with the training of more researchers who can carry out computational modeling in the field of cell biology.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Bioinformatics and biomedicine research are fundamental to our understanding of complex biological systems, impacting the science and technology of fields ranging from agricultural and environmental sciences to pharmaceutical and medical sciences. The research requires close collaboration among multi-disciplinary teams of researchers in quantitative sciences, life sciences, and their interfaces. The 10th Annual IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM-2016) is held in Shenzhen, China from December 15-18, 2016 (https://cci.drexel.edu/ieeebibm/bibm2016/index.html). It will provide an open and interactive forum to promote multi- and interdisciplinary research and education in Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, facilitating the cross fertilization of ideas and bridging knowledge gaps. The scientific program will cover synergistic themes on genomics, systems biology, translational bioinformatics, and cross-cutting bioinformatics infrastructure to promote new research collaboration. Two special panels, Big Data and Bioinformatics, and the Bioinformatics Educational Workshop will foster discussion on research and education opportunities and barriers. As an effort to engage students, BIBM-2016 has involved them in the meeting organization and has included mentoring activities in the conference program. This support will provide the crucial funding needed to support the participation of undergraduates and graduate students in U.S.-based institutions, especially those from underrepresented groups, as a training opportunity for the next generation of scientists and engineers, thereby, broadening the scientific impact of this international conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BIBM conference solicits high-quality original research papers in new computational techniques and methods in machine learning; data mining; text analysis; pattern recognition; knowledge representation; databases; data modeling; combinatorics; stochastic modeling; string and graph algorithms; linguistic methods; robotics; constraint satisfaction; data visualization; parallel computation; data integration; modeling and simulation and their application in life science domain. The conference proceedings will be published and indexed in IEEE Digital Library.</AbstractNarration>

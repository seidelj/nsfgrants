    <AbstractNarration>The Emory Department of Mathematics and Computer Science REU Site will provide research experiences for undergraduates interested in arithmetic geometry, combinatorics, and number theory. Organized by Ken Ono (with assistance from rotating colleagues), the program plans to train 8-10 undergraduates annually in the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The participants will be chosen after a nationwide search. Recruitment will target participants from underrepresented groups as well as participants from institutions that do not offer similar STEM research activities for undergraduates. The REU program will enable undergraduate students to enjoy an enhanced learning experience, including research projects and seminars. The overall goal of the Emory REU in Arithmetic Geometry and Number Theory is to attract talented undergraduate students to careers in the mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research problems will be accessible and cutting edge, and they will be related to analytic number theory, elliptic curves, Galois representations, modular forms, partitions, and quantum modular forms. These fields have implications to real world problems involving internet security, modeling in physics and other physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

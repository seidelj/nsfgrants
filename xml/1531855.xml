    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Villanova University to acquire a next-generation sequencing platform&lt;br/&gt;focused on the Illumina MiSeq instrument. This project will support high-impact research&lt;br/&gt;programs that span the disciplines of Biology and Biochemistry, and will provide graduate and&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students with hands-on genomics experience using leading-edge technology.&lt;br/&gt;Villanova University is a primarily undergraduate institution committed to recruiting and retaining&lt;br/&gt;students from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds, and students of color&lt;br/&gt;accounted for more than 20% of full-time students in 2013. The University also has an impressive&lt;br/&gt;retention record, with 6 year graduation rates above 85% for all ethnic groups as of 2013. Ready&lt;br/&gt;access to cutting-edge sequencing technology, and to the interdisciplinary genomics and&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics approaches it facilitates, will support the Biology and Chemistry departments in&lt;br/&gt;their efforts to attract students from underrepresented groups to STEM careers. This equipment&lt;br/&gt;will allow the transformation of undergraduate and Masters genomics education at Villanova, and&lt;br/&gt;will be a centerpiece of a new course in genomics. Many Villanova students go on to attend&lt;br/&gt;professional schools or Ph.D. programs, and exposure of students to this technology will prepare&lt;br/&gt;them for the science and medicine of the future. The PI and co-PIs have an extensive record of&lt;br/&gt;mentoring students, including students on peer-reviewed publications, and preparing students for&lt;br/&gt;acceptance to top graduate programs, and the MiSeq platform will advance this student-directed&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MiSeq platform will advance the research of laboratories with diverse interests that include&lt;br/&gt;phylogenomics and phylogeography, evolution and speciation, microbial ecology in response to&lt;br/&gt;changing environmental conditions, and the study of bacterial pathogens. This technology will be&lt;br/&gt;routinely used in the immediate future by at least 5 research groups in 4 main research areas:&lt;br/&gt;1) Deep sequencing of the mRNA and small RNA transcriptomes will address fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions about how genes are regulated to control responses to stress, nutrient&lt;br/&gt;availability, and hormone signaling, and to direct cellular growth and development. These&lt;br/&gt;methods will also support investigation of how gene regulation and nutrient signaling are&lt;br/&gt;shaped by evolutionary forces.&lt;br/&gt;2) ChIP-Seq and RNA-seq methods will be used to understand changes in transcription and&lt;br/&gt;identify transcription factor binding sites in fungal and bacterial species.&lt;br/&gt;3) Targeted sequencing of genomic DNA will be used to resolve uncertainties and increase&lt;br/&gt;the resolution of phylogenetic relationships in a variety of squamate (reptile) taxa. The&lt;br/&gt;results of these experiments will have important impacts on conservation efforts for these&lt;br/&gt;groups, and will advance our understanding of the forces that drive evolution and&lt;br/&gt;speciation.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sequencing of both RNA and DNA will be used to investigate soil microbial populations,&lt;br/&gt;allowing researchers to address how changes in microbial communities impact plant&lt;br/&gt;growth and nutrient cycling in the face of climate change and nutrient pollution.</AbstractNarration>

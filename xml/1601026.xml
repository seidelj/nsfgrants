    <AbstractNarration>This is a research project at the interface of number theory, representation theory, and theoretical physics. Recent work of the investigator and collaborators has shown that certain matrices, known as R-matrices, that arise in theoretical physics in the study of statistical mechanics and phase transitions also arise in the study of a class of functions, known as Whittaker functions, that encode arithmetic information when these functions are viewed representation-theoretically, that is, when inherent algebraic symmetries are taken into account. This discovery opens the door to a rich collection of questions that will be explored in this project. It is anticipated that in the process, important new connections between number theory and mathematical physics will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, Whittaker functions on p-adic groups are a fundamental tool in automorphic forms. Whittaker functions on metaplectic covers of these groups are less well-understood, but the corresponding matrices on intertwining operators have been computed. The investigator and collaborators have shown that these matrices for the n-fold mataplectic cover of GL(n) agree with the R-matrices for a quantum group, which is a Drinfield twist of the quantized enveloping algebra of the affinized Lie superalgebra gl(1/n). The effect of the Drinfield twisting is to introduce Gauss sums into the R-matrix, and therefore to make it "number-theoretic." This clarifies a great deal, but also presents new questions that will be explored in this project. A separate but related project that will be pursued is an on-going study of connections between unique models and representations of Hecke algebras.</AbstractNarration>

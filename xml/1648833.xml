    <AbstractNarration>Young Professional Research Forum at EMBC 2016&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Young Professional Research Forum at EMBC is to provide doctoral students and early career researchers a supportive scientific forum for students to engage in inter- and multi-disciplinary scholarship focusing on organizational, technical, social, and biomedical issues surrounding health-related technologies. The Young Professional Research Forum provides for expert and peer critique of participants' work with the goal of improving their research. Student participants will also have the opportunity to receive networking support and career advice from internationally-recognized experts. Overall, the doctoral consortium brings together people who might not otherwise engage with one another and engage in inter-disciplinary research in fields involving health, computing and engineering. The Young Professional Research Forum also exposes participant to different scientific disciplinary approaches and develops the next generation of scholars in computing in the domain of health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Young Professional Research Forum at EMBC is to support doctoral students and early career researchers through constructive remarks and feedback on their interdisciplinary research from prominent researchers and through interaction with other researchers. Participants from a broad range of disciplines including biomedical informatics, computer science, information science, engineering, clinical sciences and medical informatics will give short presentations of their work and receive constructive feedback from internationally respected experts. The expert panelists will also provide student participants with career guidance and mentoring through presentations and small group advising throughout the day. In addition, Young Professional Research Forum will be held throughout the conference activities, thus participants will have the opportunity to see the conference and network with conference attendees.</AbstractNarration>

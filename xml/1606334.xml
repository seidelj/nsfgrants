    <AbstractNarration>The Differential Algebra and Related Topics (DART) VII conference will be held at the CUNY Graduate Center and City College, 09/30-10/04/2016, in New York City. The subject of differential algebra concerns the study of differential and difference equations from an algebraic point of view. The study of these types of equations has many applications outside of mathematics, including biology (population dynamics and cellular biology), chemical reactions, and physics. The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers who develop theory for these types of equations and those who develop algorithms for working with them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DART international conference series started in 2000 and has become an annual activity in the recent years. This research area includes differential and difference Galois theories, differential and difference elimination, symbolic computation in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and model theory. The conference will foster the new interactions between researchers in differential and difference algebra and researchers in model theory, algebraic geometry, and commutative algebra. Special attention will be paid to mentoring the participants who are junior researchers.

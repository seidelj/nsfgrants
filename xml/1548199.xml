    <AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology will play a key role in achieving sustainability in the global society. However, nanotechnology must itself be integrated into these solutions in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner, and with full public awareness and acceptance. Many existing nanotechnologies are currently not sustainable due to their dependence on large quantities of energy, water, and solvents, the use of non-renewable resources to develop them, or unwanted environmental impacts. The 2015 Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization (SNO) conference program will address these critical aspects of sustainable nanotechnology. The program will be built around selected important systems including agricultural, environmental. health, and energy systems. The systems focus for the meeting brings together researchers from different disciplines studying fate, effects, lifecycle assessment, and analytical challenges in a particular system (e.g. water) into the same sessions to cross-fertilize ideas between them. This is a different approach from most meetings which have separate sessions on these topics, irrespective of the system of interest. The aim of this organization is to provide researchers in a specific system the tools needed to understand how their work fits into achieving sustainability in the larger integrated system. Additional cross-cutting sessions will include manufacturing and industrial ecology, solid waste and e-waste reduction and recycling, modeling, data management, standardization of methods and data reporting, and legal and regulatory aspects. The conference will also better engage health professionals researching and testing novel nanomedicines. Three forum discussions will be: sustainability, nanoinformatics including data reporting and standardization,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SNO Conference will draw attention to the role of nanomaterials in achieving integrated systems-level sustainable solutions to society's most pressing problems including natural limited resources, greenhouse gas releases, access to clean water and food, and environmental degradation. Societal issues will be addressed in sessions on Education and Social Systems/Governance. It is anticipated that 250 participants from industry, government, academia, and NGO stakeholders will participate. The conference will attract the leading interdisciplinary scientists and will include at least 30 participants who are junior scholars (doctoral and postdoctoral students), with 20 student travel awards (5 specifically for URM students) available to encourage their participation. Thus, the conference will provide networking opportunities for scientists at different career stages. The two and half day schedule will include a number of forum discussions that will foster interactions between young investigators and more established researchers. The SNO Conference is of particular importance to new investigators as there are few if any similar conferences that address the broad topic of Sustainable Nanotechnology. In addition, scientists from underrepresented groups in science will play key roles in the conference. Specific travel awards are available for these faculty and industry participants. Participants will come from not only the U.S., but around the globe, ensuring a diverse and international expert group to facilitate stimulating discussions.</AbstractNarration>

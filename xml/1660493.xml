    <AbstractNarration>PI: Carlson, Ross P. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1660493 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial support for the Metabolic Pathway Analysis conference to be held at Montana State University is expected to bring together leading researchers and developing research students that will facilitate exchange of ideas on the very important topic of pathway analysis. The funding will facilitate participation of at least 140 researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Metabolic Pathway Analysis (MPA) conference series is an international meeting for the topological study of metabolic networks. MPA 2017 will be held July 24-28, 2017 at Montana State University (MSU), Bozeman and will be the sixth meeting in the biennial conference series. The focus will be on decoding biological principles of metabolic network structure and function using quantitative approaches in conjunction with experimental data. The funding will support the participation of international experts in metabolic network analysis by creating 8 invited speaker awards, facilitating graduate student participation by providing 32 awards covering the cost of meals at an MSU cafeteria, and broaden general participation by partially covering MSU dormitory housing costs for all attendees. The major goals of this conference proposal are to disseminate US-based scientist?s research to an international audience through a combination of oral and poster presentations, educate US-based scientists in the latest metabolic systems analysis technologies and support career development for scientists at all professional stages through face-to-face discussions with international scientists. The NSF support will be leveraged with other research funds including sponsorship by the MSU Center for Biofilm Engineering, MSU Thermal Biology Institute and the MSU Society of Women Engineers.</AbstractNarration>

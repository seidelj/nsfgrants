    <AbstractNarration>The Caltech shock-wave laboratory is the only US university-based laboratory dedicated to studying deep Earth geophysical problems with shock waves. This proposal is to maintain equipment for safe operation of the shock-wave laboratory at Caltech. The data are applied to problems across a wide range of disciplines in geophysics, materials science and planetary science. The laboratory has trained numerous graduate and undergraduate students, and visitors who have gone on to establish experimental geophysics programs around the world. Outreach activities include hosting numerous Earth science and astronomy-related television programs filming in the lab. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shock-wave facility is used to obtain equation-of-state behavior of model melts at pressures and temperatures of the lower mantle of the Earth. The ultimate goal is development of accurate models of phase equilibria and physical properties of simplified mantle and core compositions that can be compared to geophysical observables or inserted into dynamic models of phenomena like magma evolution, plume ascent, dynamo generation, and inner core growth.</AbstractNarration>

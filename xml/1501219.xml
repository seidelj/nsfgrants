    <AbstractNarration>The University of Kentucky Department of Mathematics will host the 11th annual Graduate Student Combinatorics Conference (GSCC 2015) in Lexington, Kentucky, March 27 - 29, 2015. The GSCC provides a unique and invaluable opportunity for graduate students whose research focuses on combinatorics to experience the benefits of taking part in a research conference. Apart from the keynote lectures, the GSCC focuses solely on graduate student talks. Furthermore, with only graduate students, undergraduates, and local professors in attendance, the conference provides a low pressure environment in which students can present their research and improve upon their presentation and teaching skills. The GSCC also provides an opportunity for graduate students to network by meeting other young mathematicians with similar research topics. These conferences can lead to potential joint research projects and opportunities for future collaboration. This award defrays travel costs for graduate student participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first GSCC was hosted by the University of Minnesota in 2005, with subsequent conferences held at the University of Wisconsin (2006), the University of Washington (2007), UC-Davis (2008), the University of Kentucky (2009), Auburn University (2010), Penn State University (2011), the University of Illinois-UC (2012), the University of Minnesota (2013), and again at Auburn University (2014). Two keynote speakers have been invited to each give a one hour lecture at the 2015 GSCC. Topics discussed will include extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, with focus on graphs and hypergraphs, and a range of combinatorial topics such as partition theory, lattice point enumeration, and permutation statistics.

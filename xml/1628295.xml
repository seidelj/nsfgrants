    <AbstractNarration>NSF has made an award in support of a "BMES-NSF Special Session on Research in BME and Grant Writing" outside the regular program of the Annual Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) being held in Minneapolis, MN, October 5-8, 2016. The funding will be used to promote, convene and record the session and offset travel costs and registration fees for NSF awardees (5) and reviewers (2) who will serve as presenters, panelists, and potential mentors/collaborators for novice and emerging investigators participating in the session. The 3 hour session, featuring presentations showcasing NSF funded research and researchers (2 CAREER awardees and 1 non-CAREER awardee), a Networking Reception, a Tutorial on Essential Elements to Develop a Successful NSF BME Grant, and an Interactive Grant Writing and Submission Panel Discussion, will be held on October 7, 2016. The recorded session will be posted on the BMES website for on demand viewing. These special sessions, which began in 2013, contribute to a comprehensive approach by BMES, whose annual meeting serves as the premier conference for the Biomedical Engineering community, in partnership with NSF to ensure development of a diverse, well educated, and technically competent biomedical engineering workforce.</AbstractNarration>

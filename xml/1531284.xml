    <AbstractNarration>Atmospheric fine particle organic aerosol (OA) is a known factor in human respiratory and cardio-vascular health and is also a source of uncertainty in climate change, though direct and indirect effects. It is also known that a very large fraction (80-90%) of the submicron (PM1) particle mass arrives via condensation, and that OA evolves to that state in a dynamic cycle of oxidation, condensation, evaporation, and further chemical transformation. A factor limiting our understanding of the reaction paths is that many of these compounds are extremely sticky (surface active), presenting a challenge to their handling and subsequent analysis. Recently developed instrumentation, specifically gas-phase chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface time-of flight-mass spectrometry (CI-APCI-TOFMS), offers the promise of dynamically analyzing, both in laboratory and field studies, condensable organic compounds before they either reach particle size, and after they react and volatilize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be deployed principally in the Carnegie Mellon (CMU) Air Quality Laboratory to support organic aerosol research experiments. The lab is a shared facility run by a team of CMU investigators with an established history of collaborative research and equipment sharing. The instrument is also field-deployable by design, allowing improved research into new aerosol particle formation. CI-API-TOFMS data may thus inform local, state and national regulatory and policy decisions, ultimately to the public benefit.</AbstractNarration>

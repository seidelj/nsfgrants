    <AbstractNarration>The primary goal of the US Ignite Initiative is to break a fundamental deadlock: there is insufficient investment in gigabit applications that can take advantage of advanced network infrastructure because such infrastructure is rare and dispersed. And conversely, there is a lack of broad availability of advanced broadband infrastructure for open experimentation and innovation because there are few advanced applications and services to justify it. US Ignite applications are focused on national priority areas of advanced manufacturing, clean energy and transportation, cyber learning, health IT, and public safety/emergency preparedness. Many of the applications under development in this program build on NSF-funded advanced networking and computational infrastructure developed as part of the NSF GENI program. All of the projects demonstrate the value of advanced networking. This project supports the 3rd annual US Ignite Application Summit, an event that will demonstrate the next generation applications currently being developed, educate a broad community on the potential for next-generation application capabilities and recruit cities and individuals for the next round of application development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Applications Summit is being held March 24-25, 2015 at George Washington University's Marvin Center in Washington, DC and the Hilton Crystal City Hotel in Arlington, VA. Co-location with the GENI Engineering Conference (GEC 22) and meetings of the Open Grid Forum (OGF) and Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF) will maximize the potential for advancing technology, education, and outreach. This project supports academic and student participation in the Summit, along with the costs of hosting the event and broadly disseminating its results throughout the advanced networking research and gigabit application development communities.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Description: The large-scale deployment of photovoltaics requires solutions for reliable devices fabricated on flexible substrates with affordable and scalable processes. This project aims at addressing complex reliability issues that affect stable electrical output and lifetime of emerging perovskite photovoltaics. The interdisciplinary research entailed in this proposal simultaneously addresses the scalability challenge and the technological translation for next generation photovoltaics. The proposed research has a potential for significant societal impact through the development of enabling technology for sustainable energy generation and the education of students and community members at all levels. Through graduate student mentorship and outreach, this project enhances fundamental understanding of sustainable energy generation, materials design, and photovoltaic device engineering to enable undergraduates, K-12 students, and community education. By collaborating with the Clean Energy Institute, the UW MSE department, and the university, it helps broaden community impact and train graduate students to be highly capable leaders in science, education, and technology translation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The proposed research uses a unique, integrated approach to design suitable materials and device interfaces to directly address perovskite solar cell hysteresis, one of the most important challenges that may prevent large-scale implementation of perovskite-based solar technology. To solve the challenging and complex hysteresis problems, the proposed research (1) investigates the origin and mechanisms behind hysteresis while simultaneously addressing them at the perovskite bulk and interfaces, (2) modifies intrinsic hybrid perovskite properties through fabrication of novel perovskite solid solutions with new alloying elements like bismuth, and (3) enhances fundamental understanding of perovskite device hysteresis as well as the material and interface structure-property relationships governing it. The systematic approach entails first establishing essential material and interfacial structure-property relationships through model systems followed by implementing these design rules to realize efficient and reliable perovskite solar cells with little to no hysteresis. The application of low-temperature, solution processable materials enables the facile translation to flexible substrates for fabricating large-area and stable perovskite solar cells.</AbstractNarration>

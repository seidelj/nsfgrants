    <AbstractNarration>Theories of the early Universe predict a very weak polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background radiation. However, stronger signals from interstellar clouds and magnetic fields in our Milky Way Galaxy prevent scientists from measuring that faint signal. The space between the stars contains many such clouds of gas and dust. Dramatic astronomical images reveal them - for example, the Great Nebula in the constellation Orion or the famous Eagle Nebula. Dust grains in the interstellar clouds also polarize reflected starlight weakly. Astronomers can measure this weak polarization in order to find the interstellar clouds. In this project, the Investigators will construct a novel instrument to measure the optical polarization produced by interstellar dust clouds. Using these measurements with spacecraft data, they will map the locations of Galactic clouds and magnetic fields. Scientists can then separate their signals from the cosmic microwave background radiation. This project serves the national interest by increasing our knowledge of the early Universe. The Investigators will involve an international team of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs in all aspects of this project, giving it strong Broader Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Investigators will design and build a novel wide-area linear optical polarimeter (WALOP) and will use the instrument to measure polarization caused by interstellar dust and to map the distribution of dust in the Milky Way Galaxy. With a 30 x 30 arcminute field of view, the polarimeter will form four simultaneous images of each star, enabling determinations of the magnitude, fractional polarization, and polarization angle for each object. It will be deployed on a 1-meter telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). Combined with distance measurements from the GAIA spacecraft, the polarization data will enable 3D tomography of the interstellar medium, providing information that may enable scientists to extract the very weak polarization signal expected from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The Intellectual Merit of the work derives primarily from the fact that improved mapping of the dust distribution in the Galaxy may enable astronomers to detect a predicted weak polarization signal (the so-called "B-mode" signal) in CMB radiation, significantly improving cosmologists' understanding of the very early Universe. The observations also will improve astronomers'understanding of dust formation, evolution, composition, and alignment by magnetic fields in the Galaxy. The investigators plan strong programs aimed at undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs at Caltech, at IUCAA in India, at the SAAO, and at the University of Crete in Greece, combining instrument development with cutting-edge astrophysics and cosmology programs and including reciprocal visits among the partner institutions.</AbstractNarration>

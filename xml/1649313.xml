    <AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation has a strong commitment to broadening participation in engineering among underrepresented groups. Women, especially those from diverse communities, are underrepresented in the engineering workplace as well as collegiate programs that prepare them to work in this sector. To increase representation of women of color in engineering, this project focuses on engaging and supporting high school-aged, underrepresented girls with transitioning from high school to engineering majors at the collegiate level. While the initial program is small in scope, the investigator anticipates that the project will evolve into a national program that will be duplicated throughout Society of Women Engineers' 10 Regions and over 400 sections. The project will allow the Society of Women Engineers to build strong collaborations with public school systems to increase participation of underrepresented girls in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By targeting third and fourth year high school students, the investigator aims to expose underrepresented girls to cutting-edge, hands-on engineering and technology activities at their local high schools as well as invite them to attend the Society of Women Engineers' national conference to participate in hands-on STEM activities, attend special engineering informational workshops, and connect with engineering professionals and other potential mentors. In closing, the project offers an abundance of opportunities, where underrepresented high school girls will be able to network with engineering mentors and other high school girls who are interested in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of an experiment authoring system to guide students in designing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting their own experiments. The Behavioral Research Instruction Through E-Prime (BRITE) project is designed to integrate research methods, design, and analysis instruction in a series of modules that build upon one another. The key feature of the project is that each module provides students with hands-on experiential applications of behavioral research. Each module includes the activities of research according to the scientific method culminating in the students designing, conducting, analyzing, and reporting their own experiments. The application of the E-PrimeÂ® experiment authoring system provides students with a high-powered research tool that they need to produce high quality, current research to answer questions they will find interesting. The curriculum integrates the different parts of behavioral research and carefully sequences them to build skills and understanding in an appropriate timeline. Having students conduct current research using E-Prime helps them gain competence and develop positive attitudes toward experimental behavioral research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BRITE research modules to be scaled to a larger user base will promote flexibility of implementation so that faculty in universities, small colleges, and community colleges can apply them over one or two semesters, with or without a formal laboratory. Online delivery is anticipated and modules will be supported by a student access to E-Prime and possible textbook bundles. In addition to the student materials, there will be online support materials, and a help system for course instructors. The project is innovative in that is integrates the necessary skills for research making them current, accessible, hands-on, and interesting for students. The E-Prime software gives students the tools needed to precisely manipulate variables via computational resources widely available to students and accurately measure behaviors including reaction times. An engaged student learning method such as the BRITE program help students to apply the concepts they learn, solidifying learning gains and helping students to become competent research scientists.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Florida is to support postdoctoral scientists and junior faculty members to attend a conference titled "20th American Conference on Crystal Growth and Epitaxy (ACCGE-20)." This conference will be held along with "17th U.S. Biennial Workshop on Organometallic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (OMVPE-17)" and "The Second 2D Electronic Materials Symposium" at Big Sky, Montana from August 2 to 7, 2015. The aim of the organizers is to secure a multidisciplinary character of the meeting and cover different scholarly directions. Biomimetic and biomaterials research provides an exciting and broad platform for training both undergraduate and graduate students in the materials area. It is both visually appealing to those who are not yet experts, and deals with materials that everyone is familiar with, such as bones, teeth, sea shells, etc. The conference will be open for graduates and undergraduate students including broader participation of women and underrepresented minority groups. The format of the conference will provide various opportunities to students and junior scientists to attend state-of-art lectures of the top scientists and meet with them, present their results, participate in discussions and explore future networking and collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: This five-day symposium has been designed to bring together researchers from a diverse set of fields to discuss crystallization in general, with a focus on biological and biomimetic materials. The planned sessions on biomineralization will include state of the art characterization techniques and computational simulations in advancing fundamental understanding of biocrystallization processes. Specific areas of interest include classical versus non-classical crystallization phenomena in the crystallization of biological materials and bio-inspired/biomimetic materials. Additional areas of interest include interactions at organic - inorganic interfaces, self-organizing systems, novel characterization methodologies, and multiscale modeling of crystallization within both natural and synthetic biomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

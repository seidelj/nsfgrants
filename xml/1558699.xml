    <AbstractNarration>The chemical reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water in the marine environment is a fundamental process that creates carbonic acid (H2CO3) and all of the associated chemical ions (carbonate (CO3); hydrogen ions (H+), and bicarbonate (HCO3-)) that serve as the dominant buffer for pH in the ocean. Dehydration refers to the opposite reaction that releases CO2 gas. By entering into important reactions and serving to control pH, these species govern a wide variety of chemical and biological processes in the ocean. Surprisingly, while the important reactions that involve CO2 hydration and its resulting products have been extensively studied in the ocean, some of the fundamental mechanisms remain poorly understood and datasets are sparse. In particular, almost nothing is known about how the natural isotopes of the carbon and oxygen atoms are involved and this is critically needed to explain observed changes in chemical species and solid calcium carbonate such as that created by coral reefs. This research aims to carefully produce novel experimental data that includes critical measurements of carbon and oxygen isotopes before and after the hydration of CO2 in the ocean. Because these resulting carbonate species are used widely in many studies in the ocean sciences, particularly those examining past climates, this research will have far-reaching influences. Additionally, the results will provide new fundamental insight on exactly how the ocean will take up and respond to changing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 in a changing climate. The research will fund an early-career scientist who is dedicated to graduate and undergraduate education as well as scientific outreach to the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While hydration/dehydration of CO2 in the ocean critically influences a variety of marine chemical and biological processes, there are certain aspects of the reaction that are poorly understood. The molecular mechanism is not yet clear, as there are two possible pathways that have been proposed. Additionally, kinetic isotope effects during CO2 have not been well studied, and the data regarding this topic is inconsistent. This research aims to study the carbon and oxygen isotope fractionation, which will not only clarify the molecular mechanism of the reaction but also will add a consistent dataset on kinetic isotope effects. The main challenge in this study is separating the product, HCO3-, from CO2 before re-equilibration, but the researcher will resolve this by rapidly precipitating dissolved carbon as carbonate. Since carbonates formed from the process of hydration are considered critical indicators of water chemistry, biological processes, and the inorganic carbon cycle as a whole and are used in a wide variety of oceanographic research, particularly as paleo-proxies, this research will provide fundamental mechanistic data that will greatly advance studies reaching beyond the physical chemical measurements that will be made here.</AbstractNarration>

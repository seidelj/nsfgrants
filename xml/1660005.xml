    <AbstractNarration>Marine biotic communities are never perfectly fossilized in rocks because delicate organisms and those without hard parts are rarely preserved. Ya Ha Tinda in Alberta, Canada, is a newly discovered exceptional fossil deposit with extraordinary preservation of soft tissues. It is the first of its kind from North American Jurassic rocks (201 to 145 million years ago) and will generate significant new ecological data about the marine communities that lived in this region at this time and also will yield essential information about how soft tissue fossils are preserved. This deposit formed during the Jurassic Oceanic Anoxic Event, a period of significant extinctions caused by environmental changes which might be similar to predicted future conditions. The Ya Ha Tinda study will provide vital new information about the influence of this global event on ocean communities. Results of this work will be shared with the public through field blogs, lectures, interactive fairs, and institutional outreach programs. Specimens will be included in museum exhibits at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology and as a virtual display through the UT Austin Non Vertebrate Paleontology Lab. Additionally, a hands-on teaching module on extinction events will be developed for an 8th grade science class with material for the visually impaired. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chief goals of this project are to: 1) assess the Ya Ha Tinda faunal composition, extinction, and recovery dynamics; 2) compare these data with coeval deposits from Europe; 3) develop a model for soft tissue preservation at Ya Ha Tinda; and 4) determine if preservation was driven or enhanced by the Oceanic Anoxic Event. The project will integrate paleontological, sedimentological, and geochemical research on the Ya Ha Tinda fossils and compare the data with European specimens from black shale deposits of the same age to provide a unique perspective on this global anoxic event. Fossils will be analyzed with microscopy and analytical geochemistry on a newly-designed scanning electron microscopy-based instrument, which allows oversized, 3D samples to be quantitatively analyzed.</AbstractNarration>

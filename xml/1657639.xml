    <AbstractNarration>Organic molecules that bind and transport iron are called siderophores. Because iron is an essential trace element for biological systems and exists at very, very low concentrations in the open ocean, siderophores perform a critical role in capturing iron for cellular function. It is known that marine bacteria can produce two different types of siderophores that either tightly bind iron or only weakly do so, with different ecological consequences. This researcher will leverage an exceptional career on metal-organism interactions to examine the unsolved question of exactly what environmental and biochemical conditions (for example the availability of iron) control bacterial production of various siderophores. Results will generate significant new understanding of a critical chemical oceanographic process, and cap this researcher's groundbreaking discoveries that have built to this project. Funding for this research will also support the advancement of women in science by both providing the highest quality training of a female scientist and providing the opportunity for her to host an oceanography booth at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab's "Young Women in Science" conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use Vibrio harveyi as a model organism to investigate a variety of questions surrounding the marine bacterial production of weak and strong siderophores. To start, the investigation will look into how siderophore production is controlled by varying iron availability and quorum sensing (i.e. a coordinated response correlated to population density and/or certain signaling molecules). This also includes in-depth investigation of the impact of life phase and biochemical changes with growth as they relate to coordinated use of weak and strong siderophores. Using established protocols for genetic manipulation of V. harveyi, the researcher plans to discover how varying combinations of weak and strong siderophores maximize the uptake of iron. The broader biogeochemical implications of this study to the field of chemical oceanography, with regard to the microbial use of, and cellular responses to, many essential micronutrients in the ocean would be to significantly influence understanding of elemental distributions beyond the specific study of iron and siderophore cycling in the ocean.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The demand for cybersecurity research and a trained cybersecurity workforce is significant and increasing daily. The goal of this collaborative project between the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) and the Truckee Meadows Community College (TMCC) is to develop an interdisciplinary cybersecurity research and education platform. This effort is aimed towards the development of the next generation of cybersecurity scientists and professionals and to equip them with a solid grasp of different academic viewpoints, including Computer Science, Political Science, Social Psychology, Information Systems, Business, Public Policy, and Justice. The research team will have a significant impact on students through engaging interdisciplinary training and learning mechanisms. The project has both a direct and indirect impact on hands-on research, STEM education, training and career development of the graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students and ultimately, the community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this project, students will (1) learn the theory and application of cybersecurity from an interdisciplinary perspective; (2) use interactive learning materials and tools; and (3) engage in hands-on transformative experiences through cyber-games and state-of-the-art testbeds. The main contribution of the project is to develop instructional modules that can be incorporated in a variety of courses by fostering a holistic approach towards cybersecurity through collaboration across disciplines. The project brings faculty from different disciplines together to develop modular library packages while keeping each major's background in mind and also adopt them seamlessly into the learning environment of each discipline. The modular nature of the developed library packages and replicable teaching materials and activities will help in wide dissemination and usage throughout the nation. This project will assist in sustaining long-term research/education partnerships and will nurture a workforce of cybersecurity professionals who will be able to integrate technical, legal, psychological, political and financial aspects of cybersecurity into a practical, secure and dependable cyberspace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Advanced Technological Education program is providing co-funding for this project in recognition of the project's contribution to technician education in community colleges</AbstractNarration>

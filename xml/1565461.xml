    <AbstractNarration>The study of oceanography requires seagoing research for collection of&lt;br/&gt;data and at sea experimentation. However, for first time researchers the planning, organizing,&lt;br/&gt;logistics and paper work involved in a major research cruise, especially one that involves&lt;br/&gt;work in foreign waters (EEZs) can be daunting. Additionally, at sea research involves substantial&lt;br/&gt;additional grant costs attributable to the ship operation. As a consequence, beginning in&lt;br/&gt;2011 the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) began a program of Chief&lt;br/&gt;Scientist training cruises to introduce prospective early career scientists to the process&lt;br/&gt;of planning, acquiring, effectively utilizing, and reporting on time at sea for multi-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research and education. To date there have been 5 successful Chief Scientist training cruises,&lt;br/&gt;with a sixth cruise, focused on Robotic Platforms, scheduled to take place this November.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal would fund a sixth Chief Scientist Training Cruise training cruise to be conducted&lt;br/&gt;aboard the R/V Thomas G Thompson. The training program is modeled on the proven successful&lt;br/&gt;one that have already occurred. This would be the first training cruise conducted using a&lt;br/&gt;Global Class research vessel,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this proposal funds will be used to conduct a general Chief Scientist Training Cruise in 2016.&lt;br/&gt;The training cruise will follow the proven model of previous successful ones and provide a&lt;br/&gt;forum for early career marine scientists to learn how to plan, acquire utilize and report on at sea&lt;br/&gt;research for multidisciplinary research and education. The cruise will utilize the R/V T.G.&lt;br/&gt;Thompson, and it will be the first Chief Scientist training cruise on one of UNOLS? Global Class&lt;br/&gt;research vessels. As such, the ship will be able to accommodate up to 20 trainees. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;instruction on duties and responsibilities of a Chief Scientist, the cruise will offer new&lt;br/&gt;investigators opportunities to test compelling research areas that could be used for the basis of&lt;br/&gt;future proposals. Given the declining number of vessels in the UNOLS fleet and the tight&lt;br/&gt;operations budget, the need to teach early career scientists how to use our limited infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;resources effectively and collaboratively is more important than ever.</AbstractNarration>

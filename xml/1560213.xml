    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at the University of North Florida (UNF) which is located in Jacksonville, Florida. A total of 10 undergraduates will participate in the 10-week program each summer for three years. The theme of the program, which is hosted by the UNF Department of Biology, is focused on Coastal Biology, particularly threats to the biological resources of the north Florida coast. Coastal ecosystems represent some of the most biologically productive areas on Earth, but are also some of the most affected by human activity. Wide fluctuations in environmental conditions also occur frequently in coastal ecosystems. These factors influence all aspects of the biology of coastal organisms, from their molecular biology and genetics to the growth and survival of their populations. Students will have the opportunity to conduct independent research on a range of subjects related to coastal ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the program is to enhance the training and career development of early stage (rising Sophomores/Juniors) undergraduates who have not had significant research experience by engaging them in research related to the coastal ocean environment. Students will be recruited nationwide and from a variety of urban universities, including Edward Waters College (EWC). They will be paired with biologists from UNF or the collaborating institution Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve to conduct mentored research projects on major threats to coastal biological resources in North Florida. Students will develop short research proposals on their project which will be presented to faculty mentors and other REU participants in an oral format. In the final week, students will present the results of their studies in a poster session that is open to the UNF community. Students will also be encouraged to present their research findings at professional conferences and/or in manuscripts submitted to professional journals. Additional career guidance on topics such as designing research posters, scientific writing, finding and applying to graduate schools, and presenting scientific information to a public audience will be provided in workshops. Students will attend regular research seminars by UNF faculty, graduate students and scientists from other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Many organizations that develop software are utilizing continuous integration&lt;br/&gt;processes, in which engineers merge code frequently with the mainline codebase,&lt;br/&gt;and continuously regression test it. The pace at which evolution occurs in&lt;br/&gt;such environments, and the numbers of tests that must be run, can be staggering.&lt;br/&gt;To ensure the quality of software in these situations, testing processes need&lt;br/&gt;to adapt quickly to changes in available resources, testing request frequency,&lt;br/&gt;and product release cycles. Tests must be chosen and scheduled appropriately,&lt;br/&gt;tests must be analyzed for robustness, and testing processes must be&lt;br/&gt;appropriately monitored. The proposed work addresses these needs, and by&lt;br/&gt;focusing on software dependability, the work promises to benefit both&lt;br/&gt;producers (i.e., software developers) and consumers (i.e., the public at large)&lt;br/&gt;of software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will create new techniques for scheduling test cases during&lt;br/&gt;continuous testing based on their historical effectiveness, the relationships&lt;br/&gt;between tests and changes, and their potential for execution; these techniques&lt;br/&gt;will also be able to adapt to release practices and environmental changes, and&lt;br/&gt;will be supported by analysis techniques that are efficient enough for use in&lt;br/&gt;CI testing situations. The work will involve studying the effect of problems&lt;br/&gt;related to test design, and developing lightweight static and dynamic&lt;br/&gt;techniques for analyzing test cases and test suites to determine whether they&lt;br/&gt;may be problematic. The work will lead to the creation of new approaches for&lt;br/&gt;test monitoring, and the definition of new metrics that capture test and test&lt;br/&gt;suite attributes and states for the assessment of testing results in continuous&lt;br/&gt;testing processes. Finally, the work will result in the creation of&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure to support rigorous empirical assessments of the techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed.</AbstractNarration>

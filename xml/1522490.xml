    <AbstractNarration>Advances in technology, such as high-resolution acoustic imaging sonar, are enabling researchers to visualize and measure animals and habitat features within estuarine and coastal ecosystems, where waters are typically too cloudy for standard video cameras. This award is for the acquisition of an acoustic imaging sonar at the University of South Carolina's Baruch Marine Field Laboratory (BMFL; www. baruch.sc.edu) for conducting research and enhancing education at levels ranging from early grade school to lifelong learning programs. The acoustic imaging sonar, in combination with traditional (e.g., nets, environmental sensors) and other advanced (e.g., aerial imaging, terrestrial laser scanners) field sampling techniques will allow researchers and educators to probe far beyond what is currently possible in these dynamic and challenging aquatic habitats. Acoustic imaging sonars transmit sound pulses and convert the returning echoes into high-resolution digital images, much like a medical ultrasound sonogram. Thus, acoustic imaging sonars can "see" in zero visibility conditions, making it possible to track motile organisms and delineate underwater structures. Unhindered by the turbid waters of estuarine and coastal environments, acoustic imaging can operate during both day and night, with minimal or no disturbance to animals or habitats, and at much reduced labor intensity (e.g., 1 person). Together these attributes provide unmatched and powerful observational and experimental research opportunities at the BMFL that will foster new collaborations with both outside and campus-based investigators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-resolution acoustic imaging will be used to address questions about organism-habitat relationships, physical processes, and animal behavior in these previously impenetrable estuarine and coastal habitats. It will greatly advance our understanding of how these ecosystems function. With applications in a broad range of disciplines using experimental approaches in both the field and laboratory, high-resolution acoustic imaging sonar will enhance and expand research capabilities and productivity at the BMFL. Experiments based on observations from numerous readily available on-site historical databases will enable scientists to develop and test hypotheses and discover mechanisms responsible for observed patterns and relationships. Further, because the coastal and estuarine habitats surrounding the BMFL are protected in perpetuity, the potential for long-term comparative studies using the North Inlet estuary as an undisturbed control site is high. With well-equipped facilities at the edge of the North Inlet estuary, the BMFL has a decades' long history of interdisciplinary research, data management, and education and outreach. Accordingly, the BMFL is well positioned to use high-resolution acoustic imaging to develop novel lines of inquiry through collaborative research, initiate and maintain long-term project databases, train young scientists, and create exciting and engaging interactive educational activities for students of all ages and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

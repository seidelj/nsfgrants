    <AbstractNarration>1539816 (Gaustad). The International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST) attracts participants from multiple disciplines to focus on issues related to sustainability science and engineering. This conference covers a spectrum of issues for assessing and managing products and services across their life cycle, and the design, management, and policy implications of sustainable engineered systems and technologies. The conference has significant participation from students and young faculty members, which is critical for generating the next generation of sustainable solutions. This grant is for funds to help expand the participation of students, underrepresented groups, and junior faculty from across the United States in ISSST 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The solution of complex sustainability issues can only be achieved via trans-disciplinary approaches. Cross pollination of ideas among natural scientists, engineers, social scientists, and policy makers is necessary for developing a holistic understanding of sustainability applicable to engineered systems, products, and supply chains and the critical infrastructures on which they depend. ISSST 2015's theme is collaboration and this theme will be advanced with a variety of networking and learning opportunities. By providing opportunities for educational exchange among academics, government, and industry representatives, opportunities will be enhanced for the design and development of sustainable systems and technology. Further, ISSST 2015 is designed to fill key knowledge gaps and broaden the existing sustainability community base to include social and ecological scientists.</AbstractNarration>

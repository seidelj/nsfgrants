    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the "Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems Workshop" series held in the spring semesters of the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The workshop serves to bring together young researchers and senior researchers in the field, disseminating recent breakthroughs in ergodic theory and dynamical systems and fostering collaborations in the area. The NSF funding for the workshop provides support for younger researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and assistant professors), including those from groups underrepresented in mathematics. This workshop also strives to have a global impact in the mathematical community, with specific emphasis to recruit participants and speakers from Africa and Latin America. Additionally, the workshop will continue to serve as a platform of recruitment at U.S. institutions for graduate students from developing countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year the workshop begins with a colloquium presentation by a distinguished keynote speaker. The next three days of the workshop include talks by main speakers that serve to headline the workshop days, semi-expository talks by senior researchers that provide junior researchers with an introduction to their research areas, and talks by graduate students upon recommendation from their advisors. The 2016 workshop (held April 7-10, 2016) features presentations on partially hyperbolic dynamics and on asymptotic properties of group actions and the relations between objects associated to them. A highlight of the workshop is the Problem Session, where participants share open questions and new areas of research for possible collaboration. The successful collaborations created are evidenced by the four proceedings which have resulted from the previous workshops, published by Contemporary Mathematics and Walter de Gruyter.

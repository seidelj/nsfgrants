    <AbstractNarration>There is a critical need in this nation for well-educated, well-prepared STEM professionals. Ocean industries, in particular, are experiencing a severe shortage of skilled workers, with the demand for electronics technicians, engineers, and computer scientists at the top of their lists. This project seeks to address the demand for STEM professionals, with a focus on those with knowledge of ocean applications, by building the pipeline of students interested in and well-prepared for STEM careers. The typical customer of the proposed innovation is a middle or high school science/engineering/technology teacher looking for a creative, semester-long curriculum that integrates engineering, science, and applied math and is aligned with the Next Generation of Science Standards (NGSS). It is believed these teachers would make up 70-80% of the customer base; the remainder would be elementary school teachers, informal educators, parents, and college and university educators (who are providers of K-12 education activities or professional development).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed innovation is a comprehensive learning package that includes curriculum (e.g. a lesson and activity book) aligned with NGSS?s Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science standards, an ROV (remotely operated vehicle) kit, and lab packs of resources (e.g. electronic components) for middle school and high school. The team envisions these efforts to result in an e-book(s) that includes how-to videos and demonstrations; and perhaps a hard copy also. The ROV kits are in the beta stage of development, and the team continues to make improvements based on customer feedback and own R&amp;D. The curriculum is in a proof-of-principle stage; foundational learning outcomes have been defined, but more will be added.</AbstractNarration>

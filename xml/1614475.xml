    <AbstractNarration>This award will support the Particle and Nuclear Physics group at James Madison University as a key contributor to state-of-the-art research in intermediate energy nuclear physics while providing an outstanding educational experience for undergraduate students. The group's research is focused on exploring the structure of the basic building blocks of matter, protons and neutrons. It is known that protons and neutrons are composed of three interacting quarks but the mechanisms that produce and govern the evolution of multi-quark systems are not fully understood. The group will address this by scattering photons from protons and neutrons to detect and analyze the resulting particles. The group is also involved in measuring fundamental properties of the muon, which can be thought of as a heavy electron. The Particle and Nuclear Physics group at James Madison University group has an established track record of strong undergraduate student involvement in research. This award will provide enhanced educational opportunities for students as well as significant outreach activities, promoting science and educating beyond the university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The members of the group are spokespersons on two experiments approved to run at Jefferson Lab. One of these experiments was identified is currently scheduled to run in March 2017. The group is also an important contributor to the BONuS12 experiment, which was identified as a high priority Jefferson Lab experiment, and is currently scheduled as the second physics experiment to run using the CLAS12 detector in Hall B. The main activities for the duration of this proposal include commissioning detectors built by the group for Jefferson Lab, participating in data taking and analysis for various Jefferson Lab experiments, as well as installation and commissioning of the g-2 detector at Fermilab. The members of the JMU-PNP group will continue their R&amp;D detector work for future nuclear physics experiments. This work, carried out in the group's labs at James Madison University, will augment the group's capabilities and expertise in scintillator-based detectors and associated readout electronics.</AbstractNarration>

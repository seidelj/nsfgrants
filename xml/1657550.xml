<AbstractNarration>The proposed center seeks to establish a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) addressing the research of cyber-physical systems for use in the hospital and operating room environments. The center will focus on computational science and technologies to advance, develop and promote research into the principles and technology of computational surgery science.  This will be achieved through research, development, education, and technology exchange among academic, industry, hospitals and government entities via the I/UCRC framework.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new center seeks to address an interdisciplinary area of central national economic importance. The center will endeavor to create a confluence of computational science, robotics, biomedical engineering, and medical expertise to positively impact the delivery of quality procedural and surgical interventions.  The proposed center has the potential to bring together a diverse set of member companies and academics to achieve its goals as well as spawn new start-ups.  The center plans to leverage an international network and new curriculum in computational surgery in order to achieve research and student impact.</AbstractNarration>

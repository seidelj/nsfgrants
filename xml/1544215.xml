    <AbstractNarration>Title: 2015 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) on Types, Logic, Semantics, and Verification&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides student travel and subsistence for the 2015 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS). This summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study theoretical topics related to programming languages and methods/verification. The focus of this year's school is "Types, Logics, Semantics, and Verification". The students who attend are from a large number of countries. The broader significance and importance include building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of US students, including women and underrepresented minorities, with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers. The school will thus train the next generation of programming languages, compilers and software engineering researchers in both industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>

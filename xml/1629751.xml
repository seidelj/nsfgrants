    <AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment for the R/V Pelican, a 116 foot Coastal vessel operated by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. The vessel is owned by the LUMCON and the mission of the ship is to support funded science research in the Gulf of Mexico. With this proposal, LUMCON provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following equipment:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Hawboldt SPRE-2244/RS Appendix A&amp;B compliant CTD Winch $205,800&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF). The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

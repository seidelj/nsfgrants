    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to New Mexico State University to acquire an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer, to be housed in the Chemical Analysis and Instrumentation Laboratory. This instrumentation is the state-for-the art for chemical characterization of extremely complex mixtures and will be used in a wide variety of applications that range from alternative fuel research to disease research and fundamental biology. This instrument will be used to describe the chemical composition of complex mixtures to help improve the manner in which biomass is cultivated and processed into fuel and will be a key component to multiple health-related research projects including the imaging of live cells. Given the wide range of applications where the instrument will be used, this research will generate both novel applications and significant advancements in the application of this technology. Finally, the collaborative research projects that use the Orbitrap Fusion will provide a framework for discovery that will improve the ability of our institution to recruit and retain excellent faculty and will provide enormous opportunity for student participation in science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this acquisition is twofold. First, this acquisition will enable mass spectrometry-based proteomics for a number of collaborative research projects. Modern proteomic capability is currently absent in the state of New Mexico. The Orbitrap Fusion instrument architecture includes three orthogonal fragmentation techniques (electron transfer dissociation, collisional dissociation and higher energy collisional dissociation) and multiplex-in-time ion fragmentation capability, all of which are critical for modern quantitative proteomics and the analysis of protein post-translational modification. Second, with respect to multiple current research efforts in energy, environment and lipid applications, the Orbitrap Fusion offers excellent mass accuracy, ion transmission efficiency across a broad mass range and high resolving power for complex mixture analysis with collisional and higher energy collisional fragmentation methods to aid structural elucidation. Within those project areas, we will utilize the Orbitrap Fusion for the analysis of bio-oils and fuel precursors from biomass thermotreatment and upgrading, algal growth media and feedstocks, lipid mixtures from various biofuel feedstocks and complex environmental samples.</AbstractNarration>

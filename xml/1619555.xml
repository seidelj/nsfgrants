    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to participate in the 22nd International Symposium on Spin Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which will be held September 25 - 30, 2016. The conference covers a broad range of physics related to spin-dependent observables in nuclear and particle physics. Key features of the conference are recent results from experiments using cutting edge techniques, talks on a future polarized electron ion collider in the U.S., and new theoretical advances. Some of the technologies developed for this area of physics have found interesting applications, such as the use of polarized target technology for MR imaging of lungs and probing the surface of solids with stopped polarized muon beams. The conference organizers have actively recruited members of under-represented groups to give invited talks and serve as session conveners.</AbstractNarration>

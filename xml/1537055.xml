    <AbstractNarration>This project will provide a forum for presentations and discussions on fluvial hydraulics that will foster interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid dissemination of latest findings. It will provide an opportunity to discuss how novel methods and techniques can be used interchangeably in various fields of fluvial hydraulics. The conference will also address broader themes dealing with the societal impacts of rivers. As such, this conference will help increase public awareness of the importance of rivers for the society. By facilitating the attendance of graduate students and young career scientists, the program support is directed principally at its outreach and educational contributions. Several 1-day Master Classes and Short Courses will be organized and led by recognized international experts on well-focused topics in river mechanics, morphodynamics, transport processes and eco-hydrology/river restoration, as well as flood prediction and mitigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will partially fund specific outreach and education aspects of the 8th International Conference of Fluvial Hydraulics to be held in Saint Louis, Missouri July 11-16 2016. This meeting historically has attracted scientists and engineers with an environmental hydraulics and environmental fluid mechanics&lt;br/&gt;background, as well as scientists whose major focus areas include watershed hydrology, turbulence&lt;br/&gt;and mixing processes, sediment transport, geomorphology, geology, geography, freshwater plant&lt;br/&gt;and fish biology, and river ecology and sustainability. This is the major international meeting in the area of river processes and fluvial hydraulics. This will be the first time the meeting is held in the U.S. The conference is co-organized by IIHR Hydroscience &amp; Engineering, the University of Iowa, the Ven Te Chow Hydrosystems Laboratory of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the Saint Louis University, in partnership with the National Great Rivers Research and Education Center at Alton, Illinois. The main objective of the conference is to provide a forum for exchanging ideas and discussions on the latest advances in experimental, theoretical, and computational tools in the field of fluvial hydraulics. A selected group of recognized international experts and one leader of an US governmental agency playing a major role in national projects aimed at flood protection will be invited to present plenary talks</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Internal waves are a common manifestation of density stratification in the ocean and atmosphere, and their dynamics is a key component of solar energy conversion into transport, mixing, and dissipation phenomena that affect our planet from local to global scales. An important class of these waves, that of nearly solitary, coherent large amplitude structures, has recently been given renewed attention with the realization, thanks to instrumentation improvements and increased human activity, that such waves are ubiquitous in a wide range of geophysical settings and are easily observed in both field and laboratory experiments. In the former case, one of the main tools for collecting data over scales beyond what in-situ sensors can reasonably afford is the satellite observation of the surface expression of internal waves, seen as bands of choppy waters moving in otherwise calm seas. The in-depth investigation of the mechanisms responsible for this surface-internal wave interaction, as well as some of the ramifications in the mathematical framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of this class of wave propagations, is the main thrust of this research project. With accurate models, it becomes feasible to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing solely from surface observations the internal state of motion of the ocean due to large solitary waves. When combined with satellite and remote sensing capabilities, this would allow a global mapping of such wave motion, especially for the large swaths of world ocean, such as the South China and Andaman Seas, where these large waves are frequently observed and affect human interests such as oil-drilling and navigation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is organized around three mutually overlapping efforts that target outstanding issues in this class: (i) the derivation of asymptotic models for the coupled dynamics of free surface/large amplitude internal waves, with the goal of maintaining sufficient quantitative fidelity with respect to parent systems such as stratified Euler equations, while maintaining accessibility to analysis and numerical tools for large-scale simulations; (ii) the rigorous assessment of validity of these models (consistency, existence time scales and closeness), with particular attention to stability issues coupled with surface tension, and (iii) the implementation of the first experimental investigations in a controlled lab environment of coupled surface/internal wave dynamics, with further attention to transport and mixing of tracers. Achieving these goals relies on the application as well as the implementation of novel mathematical techniques: in (i) new asymptotic tools removing the classical weak nonlinearity assumption would have to be refined beyond those obtained in recent advancements in this direction; for (ii) the corresponding advances in the free surface formulation of the classical water wave problem have to be adapted to the internal stratified fluid dynamics, with the development of analytical estimates for surface dynamics under surface tension and internal-wave induced currents; in (iii), the combined use of surface wave generators and surfactants is implemented to explore the relevant physical parameters such as surface group velocity and internal wave phase speed, including regimes with capillary/gravity wave interactions, to validate and test the theoretical and numerical advances in coupled surface-internal dynamics with controlled experiments.</AbstractNarration>

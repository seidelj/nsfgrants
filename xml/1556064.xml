    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is a breakthrough in insect control for the agricultural industry. Provivi, Inc. intends to develop biosynthesis technology for producing insect pheromones, with a dramatic reduction in the cost of goods sold compared to existing syntheses. This will enable the use of pheromones beyond niche markets such as fruits and nuts: the target market for Provivi?s pheromone products are large acreage row crops. By introducing pheromone-based control as an inexpensive alternative in these markets, we are meeting a growing demand as conventional insecticides are becoming increasingly incapable of protecting crops due to insect resistance, regulatory constraints, and detrimental effects on beneficial insects. The societal and environmental benefits of using pheromones are numerous: pheromones are considered the safest possible insecticides with respect to human food consumption as well as environmental impact. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has characterized them as low risk. Our pheromone products will benefit consumers by creating a safer food supply with lower chemical residues, growers by introducing an effective and novel pest control solution and the environment by reducing the chemical exposure to the ecosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this Phase II research project are to improve the selectivity and productivity of our prototype biocatalyst to target commercial performance, and to demonstrate pheromone synthesis from a cheap feedstock using this biocatalyst. PRovivi's proprietary biocatalyst utilizes a novel monooxygenase to catalyze a reaction not found in nature. The research product of this project will expand the scientific knowledge for this class of biocatalysts. Additionally, since this class of biocatalysts has not been optimized for commercial viability for the specific reaction of interest, this research program could provide impactful research learnings to achieve target commercial performance. These learnings include but are not limited to changes in the biocatalyst physiology, metabolic pathways and potential stress responses. This research could provide valuable knowledge for both commercial and academic biocatalysis research that utilize this class of biocatalysts.</AbstractNarration>

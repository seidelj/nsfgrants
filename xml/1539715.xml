    <AbstractNarration>The funding from NSF will provide partial participant support at several workshops and working meetings of the Cyber Education Project (CEP). CEP goal is to establish Cyber Science curricular guidelines for undergraduate programs and to develop program criteria leading to Cyber Science program accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). At these planned meetings, CEP group will solicit, develop, and refine learning outcomes from a broad swath of cyber educators and industry supporters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By fostering dialogue among academia, the private sector, and government, the CEP will promote and drive more-rapid maturation of Cybersecurity and Cyber Science learning objectives, while significantly improving the collaboration among the sectors that will operate, sustain, and employ the persons and technology that underpin the essential core of the Nation?s critical infrastructure. The CEP expects to see a significant increase in the number of students enrolling in Cybersecurity and Cyber Science once such programs are established; stronger partnerships between employers and academic institutions that find, educate, and hire these candidates; and increased research activities to continue forward progress on relevant hard problems.</AbstractNarration>

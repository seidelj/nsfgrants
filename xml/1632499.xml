It is designed to be an agenda-setting workshop involving both experts and the general public to produce a research strategy and agenda. The workshop will focus on data science's communication patterns, tools, styles of work, analytical habits, standards, visual strategies, and professional ethics. Presentations will document the emerging social facets of data science research cultures by using historical, philosophical, and social scientific methods. The workshop will offer an opportunity for STS to apply its methods to a new scientific profession and provide STS with a chance to situate itself as a key stakeholder in the professionalization process. The workshop will increase the documentation and understanding of data science beyond the technical profession.</AbstractNarration>

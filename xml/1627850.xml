<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund Oceanographic Instrumentation for the R/V Roger Revelle, a 273? general purpose Global vessel. The vessel is operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  R/V Roger Revelle is a Global vessel owned by the Navy. She supports multidisciplinary oceanographic research in all of the world?s ocean basins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015, R/V Roger Revelle completed 306 days, 178 (58%) of which were for NSF.  The schedule for 2016 shows Revelle with 314 total days with 150 (48%) of them for NSF.  Oceanographic Instrumentation  in this proposal includes requests for:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) 24-Place Rosette R/V Roger Revelle $32,800&lt;br/&gt;2) Sea-Bird SBE32 24-Place Carousel $18,490&lt;br/&gt;3) CTD Equipment Packages $170,309&lt;br/&gt;4) Precision Salinometer $77,713&lt;br/&gt;    $299,312&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

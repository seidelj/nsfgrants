    <AbstractNarration>The investigators are leading the "Survey of the MAgellanic Stellar History" (SMASH), a project to observe two nearby dwarf galaxies, visible in the southern hemisphere. These dwarf galaxies, called the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), are a unique local laboratory for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in exquisite detail. The investigators' goal is to observe the debris left over from star formation in these galaxies. Using these observations, they will learn the history of formation of these dwarf galaxies and determine what type interactions these galaxies have had with our Milky Way Galaxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators are working with the Zooniverse team, which connects research scientists with the volunteers in the general public that want to help with research. The team will organize the data in a way that allows non-experts to group the stars into different categories, using web-based tools. The Zooniverse software tools help researchers make progress, while making the process enjoyable for the volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A decade ago, the interaction history of the Magellanic Clouds was thought to be well understood, with only minor details remaining to be explained. However, in the last decade, several important discoveries have been made which raise fresh questions about their structure and past history. The observations indicate LMC-SMC interactions alone are responsible for the formation of the Magellanic Bridge, Stream, Leading Arm and neutral hydrogen extending half way across the sky. These results point to a much richer and more complex structure than was imagined just a few years ago. The investigators observations will uncover the vast, but low surface brightness, stellar structures in the Magellanic periphery and thereby unravel the complex interaction history of the Clouds.</AbstractNarration>

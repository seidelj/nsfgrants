    <AbstractNarration>Levels of species diversity vary naturally among different environments. Much of the theory developed to understand how species diversity is maintained in particular habitats is built on the assumption that different species occupy unique niches. This means that multiple species can live together only because each species interacts with the environment in different ways. However, evidence also suggests that many species are nearly identical to one another in how they interact with the environment. Neutral ecological theory has been suggested as an alternative to niche-based theory in order to explain the apparent redundancy of coexisting species. It states that every species may not occupy its own niche and that diversity is maintained instead by species only slowly being lost by random chance. This project will conduct observational studies and field experiments to distinguish between these two alternative theories in structuring damselfly assemblages found in lakes throughout western North America. The work specifically focuses on examining how the relative importance of neutral versus niche-based processes may vary spatially with latitude. Latitude may play an important role because repeated glaciation at northern latitudes has limited the persistence of local communities there, and thus restricted the ability for niche differences to evolve in northern relative to southern communities. This research will provide valuable information for understanding how mechanisms allowing species coexistence may vary spatially, which is critical to constructing effective biodiversity management strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of biological diversity to humanity ranges from clean water to medicine, to recreation and art. This project will incorporate a range of formal and informal education activities on the topic of biological diversity, that include enhancing the science curriculum for local K-5 elementary schools, developing an undergraduate research-based curriculum, and creating a citizen science project to encourage public participation and to contribute to public understanding of biodiversity. In addition, undergraduate students will be engaged in all components of the scientific research enterprise.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for conference attendance costs by the PI and his students to attend a conference to be held August 23-28, 2015 in Hong Kong. The conference addresses the "terahertz (THz)gap" where bright sources of light and sensitive means of detection do not exist. The THz gap covres frequencies invisible to the naked eye in the electromagnetic spectrum, lying between microwave and infrared in the range from 0.3 to 3THz. The ?International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter, and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz) 2015 will address scientific and technological activities from millimeter-waves to the THz regime and the far-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics ranging from micro- and nano-scale devices and structures to large-scale accelerators and tokamaks and their applications will be covered. Other topics to be addressed include among other applications in Biology, Medicine, Security and Defense, Spectroscopy and Material Properties, Sources, Detectors, and Receivers. The conference will foster advances in the leading research of Technology by gathering a diverse group of experts.&lt;br/&gt;The conference will include plenary keynote speakers, oral paper presentations, posters sessions as well as demo and exhibition sessions that will encourage the exchange of ideas in the THz area. It will encourage young researchers in the US to present their research work to the international community working in this field and will provide a great opportunity for learning both fundamentals as well as advanced principles.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The Noyce Austin College STEM Education Leadership Scholars (ACSELS) Program is a Track 1 (Scholarships &amp; Stipends) project that will recruit, prepare, and support a minimum of 11 undergraduate majors in the disciplines of biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics to become well-prepared secondary school science and mathematics teachers. The ACSELS Program will provide scholarships, internships, and stipends to STEM majors studying to become teachers. Students will receive explicit training in leadership competencies that prepare them for working in high-need school settings as effective STEM teachers, teacher leaders, change agents, and role models for students. Noyce Scholars will complete a five-year program earning a bachelor's degree in a STEM field (biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, or physics), a minor in education, and a master's degree in education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ACSELS Project activities will impact Noyce Scholars at multiple points of their academic and professional careers. These activities include early experiences in the secondary school classroom; leadership behavior development training; mentoring from STEM faculty, education faculty, and in-service teacher mentors; and continued professional development after graduation. Scholars also will be eligible to complete a summer teaching internship in informal STEM education. Leadership behavior development training will be conducted through the STEM Teaching and Research (STAR) Leadership Program and the Leadership Education through Application and Pedagogy (LEAP) Program. The impact of formal leadership behavior development training on preparing STEM majors for teaching careers in high-needs local school districts will be investigated and contribute to knowledge generation.</AbstractNarration>

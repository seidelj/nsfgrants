    <AbstractNarration>Atoms (the particles that constitutes ordinary matter) and light interact with each other through absorption and emission of photons (individual quanta or particles of light). Such atom-photon interactions constitute one of the most basic processes in physical science, and underlie many everyday phenomena as well as many device applications in areas such as optoelectronics. Most of these processes and devices involve large numbers of atoms and intense beams of light, since the interaction between single atoms and single photons are typically negligibly weak. The interaction can be made substantial if one builds a system in which an atom interacts with light confined in a very small space. Such strong atom-photon interactions lead to many new phenomena that not only deepen our understanding of nature, but may also form the basis of future technologies. These include novel transistors based on individual photons interacting with each other, novel states of matter in which atoms and photons are intertwined with one another, and robust quantum information systems that enable advances such as secure communication over long distances and ultra-precise quantum sensors. The present research program will explore new physics by using precisely engineered hybrid systems that combine nanoscale solid structures for confining light with well-isolated atoms and "atom-like" features (color centers) in solids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the present project aims at (1) understanding interactions between ultra-cold atoms and solid-state atom-like systems with photons confined to sub-wavelength photonic and plasmonic structures, (2) creating and controlling non-classical states of light and, (3) manipulating multi-atom quantum dynamics within hybrid quantum systems of increasing complexity. The project will also explore new theoretical approaches that focus on quantum dynamics of strongly interacting photons and atoms, with emphasis on using coherent and dissipative mechanisms to control quantum many-body states. The proposed effort will not only create new hybrid systems where many ideas of quantum optics can be realized, tested, and refined, but also lay the groundwork for a number of applications, ranging from realizations of robust quantum information systems and quantum optical circuits operating at the single photon level to the development of nanoscale sensors for studying complex systems. The principal investigators will also continue to develop new and efficient ways for disseminating physics knowledge through teaching, collaborations, review articles, lecture notes, organization of workshops and summer schools. To enhance the appreciation and understanding of science by the general public, outreach efforts such as visits to local K-12 schools will be combined with colloquia and public talks.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum at Tufts University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length, which may or may not exist in our universe. Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window onto fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator. Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory. Professor Olum's research will advance our knowledge of the cosmic string network as it would exist today and would have existed in the past under any specific cosmic string theory. In particular, it will lead to accurate information about the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings. This information will allow us to determine the properties of the cosmic string network if such gravitational waves are detected in the future. If they are not detected, it will enable us to set limits on the possibilities for cosmic strings, and thus on underlying theories of high-energy physics. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of the universe. Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in the work and thus train future generations of research physicists. The work will further connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Olum will study the shape of cosmic string loops to determine how many cusps they have and to calibrate the signals that they might produce for comparison with observational limits on gravitational waves from pulsar timing. He will also study networks that might arise from cosmic strings with a low probability of reconnection when they intersect each other, as might be found in cosmic superstring theories.</AbstractNarration>

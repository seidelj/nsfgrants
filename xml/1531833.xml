    <AbstractNarration>Optical techniques for watching single molecules received the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry because of the way they are revolutionizing research in the life sciences. In laboratories around the world, the use of fluorescence to "see" individual molecules undergoing chemical changes is helping to reveal how complex molecules like proteins really work or when these proteins become disabled by genetic mutations or pharmaceutical drugs. Recently, researchers at UC Irvine have invented a new, all-electronic method for "listening" to single molecules. Instead of looking at fluorescent light coming from a protein, the electronic technique is sensitive to the movement of charges on a protein's surface. The goal of this MRI project is to develop a new type of microscope that can combine this new, electronic listening technique into the more conventional platform of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Specifically, the project will take apart a fluorescence microscope, modify the microscope to be compatible with the electronic technique, and build up a single, integrated instrument that can simultaneously watch and listen to single proteins as they do their work. For example, some proteins require one portion to bend before another portion can become chemically active. Other proteins can be disabled when a drug binds and blocks a particular motion. Being able to monitor two different portions of the same protein will be an exciting new capability for understanding cause and effect in the biochemical processes that are fundamental to healthy lives. The instrument developed in this project will add to the capabilities of two major research centers located at UC Irvine and serve as a proof-of-principle for future commercialization efforts. In addition, the instrument will contribute to the ongoing, interdisciplinary mentoring and training of undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral researchers, any of whom could contribute to similar development and commercialization efforts in the microscope industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single-molecule fluorescence techniques are exposing the complex structure-function relationships among proteins, peptides, and biopolymers. Direct observation of mechanical organization and real-time recordings of single-molecule kinetics are helping reveal how complex biochemical processes work and how they are affected by mutations and co-factors. To complement light-based techniques, researchers at UC Irvine have recently exploited the sensitivity of nanometer-scale field effect transistors to create a new single-molecule technology that is sensitive to the movement of charges on a protein surface. The electronic signals generated by these movements represent a physical mechanism that is independent of conventional single-molecule fluorescence, suggesting that a promising combination of two degrees of freedom can be used to probe individual molecules. The goal of this MRI project is to demonstrate a microscope that validates this premise. By combining the nano-transistor electronic technique with total internal reflection fluorescence imaging, the project aims to enable new types of single-molecule science that take advantage of two modes of simultaneous monitoring. For example, synchronized monitoring may distinguish between cause and effect among complex processes involving energy transfer, substrate binding, bond cleavage, and domain motions, each occurring at different sites within one protein.</AbstractNarration>

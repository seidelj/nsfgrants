    <AbstractNarration>1548409(Hovakimyan)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technological advances today have the potential to transform the life of everybody within the next 20-30 years in a dramatic way. The society of non-distant future assumes co-existence of humans, pilotless planes, driverless cars, and robots, in which machines and human beings share the airspace, the roads, and populate indoor environments. This idea poses significant challenges, falling within the scope of engineering, psychology, social science, politics, ethics, and economics. Inspired by this vision, the project proposes to lay down the foundations for the world of the future, in which cars, drones, and robotic machines autonomously co-habit and work with humans. Hence, it is important to build a scientific community, where psychologists and engineers work together in order to develop socially trustable autonomous mobile robots. More specifically, we propose to formulate rigorously relevant scientific and human centered psychological concerns (namely, actual safety, humans' perceived safety, and humans' comfort) that arise in such systems, where humans and robots are required to safely interact in a shared space. The overarching objective is to provide a general design framework and control architecture for human interaction with autonomous robots that is flexible and capable of safe operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on the problem of human centered robotic design and control. The goal of this project is to provide the foundations to address human related concerns that arise in multiple human-robot systems, where robots have to perform tasks in the presence of (and in cooperation with) humans. In particular, this proposal targets the fundamental understanding of two issues that are crucial in the integration of robotic systems into real-life human populated environments: first, how humans perceive autonomous mobile robots as a function of robots' appearance and behavior; second, how to design and control mobile robots so that to improve the level of comfort and perceived safety of the people present in the environment. The research here assumes a collaborative study, involving Mechanical Engineering, Psychology and Computer Science Departments at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in which human perception of robotic appearance and behavior is the main subject that has to define what it means for a robot to be socially accepted and to generate empathy between humans and robotic machines. Social etiquette in human-robot systems will be sought through the study of human behavior. At the initial stage of this ambitious research project, the virtual reality cave at Beckman Institute and the motion capture suite at CSL Intelligent Robotic Lab will serve as testing and validation environment to derive robots' design features and behavioral protocols toward the development of these robots. The outcome of this first step will provide the basis for further research in the field and will contribute to the sociotechnical society of the future.</AbstractNarration>

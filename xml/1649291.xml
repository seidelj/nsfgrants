    <AbstractNarration>The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program is NSF's flagship cybersecurity research program. With the increasing importance of cybersecurity to the nation as a whole, and to the Foundation as a research area, improving communication between program officers and researchers supported by NSF and other government funding agencies, coordination among PIs from the different perspectives sponsored by SaTC, and outreach to the broader community is increasingly important.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SaTC program provides national visibility with the participation of the NSF Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Engineering (ENG), Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS), and Social, Behavioral, and Economics Sciences (SBE). There are currently over 800 active awards in the program. The PI meeting will be a large, major event for the Foundation and the community, bringing together PIs with government and industry representatives. For this event there is a pressing need to meticulously plan and organize the technical program, the venue and conference logistics. This grant provides funding for the venue and conference logistics, including conference registration, audio visual, and meeting space.</AbstractNarration>

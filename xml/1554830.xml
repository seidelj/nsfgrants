    <AbstractNarration>Given the tremendous burden of polymer production on natural resources and the vast amount of the US economy derived as a result of manufacturing and selling these materials, the development of efficient processes for polymer synthesis is of great societal importance. In this research supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Kiesewetter of the Rhode Island University conducts aims to develop more efficient catalysts that function under mild reaction conditions and enable better control of the polymer structures. Graduate and undergraduate students who conduct this research receive training in catalyst development as well as polymer synthesis and characterization. In addition, a series of polymer science based workshops are being established for Rhode Island educators, including high school teachers, post-secondary lecturers, and community college professors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to develop rate enhanced catalysts and stereoselective catalysts for ring-opening polymerization. For these aims, the Kiesewetter group investigates the catalytic properties of dual H-bond donors, a largely unexplored class of catalysts. Specifically, his group designs and synthesizes achiral and chiral bisthioureas, as well as develops a mechanistic understanding of their catalytic properties through a multifaceted approach involving spectroscopic studies, chemical kinetics and thermodynamic studies.</AbstractNarration>

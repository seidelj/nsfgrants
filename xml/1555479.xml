    <AbstractNarration>This project involves laboratory studies to assess the chemical composition and optical properties of small atmospheric particles created from biomass burning. The investigators are focusing on common East African biomass sources including eucalyptus, banana trees, acacia, and animal dung. They are building an indoor smog chamber that will be connected directly to the output of a burner that will be used to generate biomass aerosols. This project will lead to a better understanding of pollutants generated from the common use of biomass for cooking and burning in developing countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is using a combination of Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS), nephelometry and a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) to measure aerosol optical properties at a wide range of wavelengths to determine absorption cross sections as a function of wavelength. Optical properties are also being measured as a function of composition and degree of atmospheric aging as the chamber is designed so that additional gases of relevant organic compounds and nitrogen oxides can be added to prepare mixtures to simulate atmospheric aging of the aerosols. Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) coupled in-line to both a Diode Array Detector (DAD) and high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source is being used to chemically characterize aerosol samples produced in the chamber experiments.</AbstractNarration>

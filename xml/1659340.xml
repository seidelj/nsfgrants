    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduates Site: Polymer Innovation for a Sustainable Future (REU) at the University of Southern Mississippi School of Polymers and High Performance Materials engages students from across the country in research aimed at sustainable approaches to materials development. Sustainable materials research addresses the challenge of meeting global societal needs while sustaining natural resources and reducing impact on the environment. REU participants perform research designed to improve utilization of energy and raw materials in state-of-the-art facilities with interdisciplinary research teams. A diverse population of students, 50% of whom are women, 27% from underrepresented groups, and 60% from primarily undergraduate institutions, are recruited to the program. Over 70% of participants seek advanced degrees in science and engineering disciplines upon graduation. The grand challenges of science and engineering for the 21st century require the engagement and the talent of the diverse student population. The REU program helps to build the pipeline of highly skilled next generation scientists and engineers necessary for the continued economic strength and prosperity of the nation. This site is funded by the REU Site Programs of the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objective of the REU site is to develop sustainable approaches to materials development to meet critical societal and technological needs. Ten students are recruited from primarily undergraduate and minority institutions across the country for a ten-week research experience. Undergraduate student researchers are engaged in fundamental research projects that span the complex, interdisciplinary facets of materials sustainability, including synthesis of polymers from renewable feedstocks, enhancing process efficiency, designing materials for environmental remediation, and improving performance in renewable energy materials. They work alongside graduate student and faculty mentors in interdisciplinary research in state-of-the-art polymer synthesis, analysis, and processing research laboratories. Participants build interdisciplinary communication skills through participative workshops and outreach activities in the community, gain exposure to materials manufacturing challenges through interaction with local polymer businesses, and gain appreciation for environmental impact of materials through lectures, field trips, and literature review. Students present their research in podium and poster formats on campus and in regional and national technical meetings. The REU site helps develop the pipeline of science and engineering researchers with the skills to address the challenges of the next century while advancing fundamental research to enable implementation of environmentally sustainable materials applications such as polymeric solar cells and polymers from renewable feedstocks for drug delivery. This site is funded by the REU Site Programs of the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The International Workshop on Conformal Geometry and Geometric PDE will be held at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research (BICMR), Beijing, China, from June 22-July 3, 2015. This is a two-week summer program that has two parts. The first part is a summer school for graduate students. The summer school will offer 5 mini-courses taught by leading experts to cover important background as well as introduce frontier research topics in the field. The second part is a research conference to facilitate and promote exchanges and interactions, particularly among young researchers and leading experts in the field. BICMR, which will host the program, is committed to support collaborations fostered in this program. The program will stimulate more research in the field and foster collaborations between researchers from US and China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in conformal geometric PDE is one of the most active research fields in geometric PDE. There has been much exciting progress in the field ranging from important developments in nonlinear elliptic and parabolic PDE, to the better understanding of 4-manifolds that satisfy conformally invariant curvature equations like Bach-flatness. This progress also extends to further investigations on conformally compact Einstein manifolds that are essential to the mathematical foundation for the so-called AdS/CFT correspondence proposed in the promising theory of quantum gravity in theoretical physics. To absorb the impact of such breadth it is clearly desirable to have a program to bring together leading experts and young researchers to disseminate and digest the rapid advancements as well as nurture creative ideas for further developments in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program website is at http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/academic-year-2015/aygp/event-2.html</AbstractNarration>

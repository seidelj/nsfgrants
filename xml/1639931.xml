    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO) of the National Academies of Science (NAS), which functions as the U.S. National Committee to the International Council for Science (ICSU) and serves as the focal point for ICSU-related activities in the United States. It manages U.S. membership in ICSU and has oversight of many of the national committees that serve as liaisons to unions, committees and programs federated under the ICSU umbrella. BISO's primary goal is to support effective U.S. participation and strong leadership in the ICSU network in response to growing needs in international science and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICSU, a non-governmental organization with a global membership of national scientific bodies (122 Members, representing 142 countries) and International Scientific Unions (31 Members). ICSU?s mission is to strengthen international science for the benefit of society. To do this, ICSU mobilizes the knowledge and resources of the international science community to 1) identify and address major issues of importance to science and society; 2) facilitate interaction among scientists across all disciplines and from all countries; 3) promote the participation of all scientists in the international scientific endeavor; and 4) provide independent, authoritative advice to stimulate constructive dialogue between the scientific community and governments, civil society, and the private sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also provides dues payment to the Pacific Science Association (PSA). PSA is an interdisciplinary regional organization within ICSU whose goal is to advance science and technology in support of sustainable development in the Pacific region. Based in Honolulu, Hawaii, PSA has a long history of linking scientists in the U.S. with their counterparts on the Pacific's rim and islands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award will enable BISO to continue to manage U.S. participation in ICSU. The award provides costs associated with the support and management of the U.S. National Committees to ICSU and organizational activities of adhering U.S. committees representing the diverse disciplines that participate in ICSU activities.</AbstractNarration>

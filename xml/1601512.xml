<AbstractNarration>This project will respond to the needs of agricultural and green industries for more precision technicians.  Precision technologies are employed by growers across the U.S. to increase crop yield, reduce production costs and minimize negative impacts to the environment.   Precision technologies are used not only in production agriculture but by a vast number of agricultural and green industries including organic farming, nurseries and sports turf management. With the increasing use of technology, there is a need for more technicians to install, repair and maintain the new technological equipment.  Through the Precision Agriculture Program, Clark State Community College will partner with leaders in the precision agriculture industry and educational institutions to increase the number of students pursuing degrees in precision agriculture and in turn will support the needs of farmers and other green industries utilizing this emerging technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clark State Community College will integrate precision agriculture and the geo-sciences by working with leaders in the precision agriculture industry and other educational institutions to  (1) grow the pipeline of Precision Agriculture students through targeted recruitment; (2) increase retention by expanding career and transfer options for precision agriculture students and (3) address the rapidly changing applications of precision technologies and prepare faculty to respond to ongoing changes in industry needs. The curriculum and knowledge developed through this proposal will be shared with other community colleges and universities through the NSF ATE National GEOTech Center website; through presentations at regional and national conferences; and through in-person faculty exchanges.</AbstractNarration>

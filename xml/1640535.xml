    <AbstractNarration>The recent deployment and integration of more renewable energy sources to the electric power grid coupled with the shutting down of nuclear units in some countries or switching over from coal to natural gas is placing unprecedented stresses on the power grids around the world. The workshop will investigate new developments in the management of power grid to address these challenges. An electricity supply less reliant on fossil fuels is central to any meaningful approach to a sustainable energy future. Encouragingly, renewable generation has grown rapidly in recent years. Internationally for reasons of safety, national security and environmental concern, we see similar trends. These changes all place new demands on the existing power transmission infrastructure. Germany and Japan have some of the most aggressive plans for moving to a low carbon future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop with the support of the Japan Science and Technology (JST) Agency and the German Research Foundation (DFG) will bring together researchers and educators in electric energy and sustainability from across the globe to discuss relevant issues to these changes. Topics for discussion include design and operation of AC/DC power system including switching, isolation, and conversion; dynamic and harmonic stability assessment of control systems; power electronic devices, circuits and systems; robustness and survivability; smart energy systems informatics, modeling, simulation and test beds; industry applications; and multinational collaborations. The workshop will examine control, communications, computational science, environmental, and social aspects of electric power and sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

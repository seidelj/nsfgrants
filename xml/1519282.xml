    <AbstractNarration>This virtual conference proposal would bring together NSF researchers and their media partners who worked collaboratively on previous NSF projects involved with communicating research to public audiences (the now archived CRPA program). The goal of the conference to is examine successful practices and lessons learned and aggregate the findings in a manner that can productively inform and support current and future efforts of this kind. The key objectives of the work will be to identify approaches that broaden reach, increase the effectiveness of researcher/outreach organizational partnerships, and make recommendations for amplifying the strategic impact of these projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior to the conference the PI will conduct a multiphase process of document review, online interviews, and questionnaires. Two virtual workshops will be conducted with a subset of previous grantees and their media partners noted for effective collaboration and outcomes. The first workshop will have participants sharing findings on project strengths and areas needing improvement based on past experience. They will identify possible generic tools and a framework that could be shared across projects. The second workshop will focus on the identified successful strategies might be implemented more widely. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this multi-component conference will help future grantees better understand, expand, and work more strategically with their outreach partners.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Organisms in Nature have crafted tools and processes to perform tasks such as foraging, eating, hunting, and burrowing with high efficiency. This award supports fundamental research that will examine mechanisms of cutting processes used by various organisms in the natural world, so as to identify new concepts that can potentially be translated into the industrial manufacturing domain. Research results can potentially lead to a class of highly efficient manufacturing processes for cutting and deformation processing of soft matter, and impact pharmaceutical manufacturing and orthopedic surgery. Given the critical importance of surgical cutting ranging from soft tissue excision to more serious orthopaedic procedures, the research could also contribute to improving quality of life by accelerating post-surgery healing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research objectives are: (1) identification of some typical mechanisms employed by insects, rodents, and other small animals in cutting and indentation processes in the natural world, and compare and contrast these against conventional manufacturing processes with soft matter in terms of efficiency and material removal mechanics; (2) characterization of key mechanical properties of soft natural material systems, relevant to these select processes, which determine their cutting and indentation response; (3) obtain fundamental knowledge on manufacturing processes used in the natural world and explain their applicability to manufacturing. To achieve the first research objective, experimental studies will be conducted on cutting and indentation processes in nature. The tool systems will include animal teeth (canine and equine) and insect mandibles (leaf cutter ants and beetles) such as mouthparts used for biting, cutting, and crushing. Experiments will be performed in both a simulated natural environment in a glass container within the lab and through instrumented lab-scale model systems. Direct observations will be performed using high speed imaging and microscopy, coupled with quantitative analysis by image correlation techniques. To achieve the second objective, mechanical properties and surface characteristics of natural tools and work materials (e.g., leaves, wood, bone, and flesh) will be examined using Atomic Force Microscopy, nano-indentation, micromechanical testing, and electron microscopy. To achieve the third objective, numerical modeling will be used to analyze the mechanics of cutting and indentation processes in two select natural systems. This modeling will be validated by experiments and then used for benchmarking against industrial cutting processes such as comminution and punching. The modeling tools will be Finite Element Analysis and moving heat source theory.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>There is a growing need for more technicians in the area of green construction technology as well as sustainable design and sustainable construction techniques. With growth in green construction jobs, the challenge is on educating the local workforce with the knowledge and skills necessary to obtain and succeed in these jobs. The University of New Mexico and Central New Mexico Community College will collaborate on this project resulting in the development of (1) a certificate program in green construction technologies to provide students with the necessary skills that lead to workforce development, (2) a pathway for students to participate in an internship program and dual credit courses (high school and college credit), and (3) outreach and mentoring efforts to expose underrepresented students to STEM fields, specifically construction technology and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a strong evaluation plan, the project will generate new knowledge about the skillset needed and the challenges faced in educating green construction technicians. The collaborative team of University of New Mexico and Central New Mexico Community College faculty will work to implement academic experiences relevant to green construction and sustainability.  Over 400 students will be impacted.  One of the key deliverables will be developing a model for internships, outreach, recruitment, and mentoring for underrepresented students. The knowledge gained will be shared with other institutions that have a focus on green construction technology and sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

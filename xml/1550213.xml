    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a workshop aimed at developing the early career NeTS research community to work on key emerging challenges and pursue challenging research agendas in the areas of computer and information networking. This workshop will provide early career participants the opportunity to engage in discussions with peers to share perspective and build research collaborations. The workshop will also include keynote and plenary talks from leaders in the field of networking on various topics pertaining to build successful research programs and identifying strong research problems. Furthermore, a group of invited mentors will actively steer discussions during breakout sessions to enable participants to find interesting and rich topics to discuss. The workshop will involve participants and invitees spanning a variety of topics in networking, including for example, wired and wireless networks, theory and systems, modeling, measurement, and network economics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This workshop presents an opportunity for rich exchange of research ideas among early career NeTS researchers and leaders in the field of networking. The participants will have opportunities to learn about how to do high-impact research in networking from the leaders in the area. If successful, the workshop may also seed strong cross-cutting research collaborations on cutting-edge problems in networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This workshop provides an opportunity to bring together early career researchers in different areas of networking to engage in discussions and form rich collaborations and to learn about key elements of building a successful research career, e.g., how to build successful large research programs, and how to identify good research problems. The workshop participants will produce a publicly-available report describing the invited talks as well as the discussions during break sessions.</AbstractNarration>

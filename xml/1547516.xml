    <AbstractNarration>The 2015 magnitude 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake was the largest earthquake at the southern edge of Tibet in the last 80 years. We will use precise measurements of surface deformation to study the earthquake rupture, as well slow relaxation of the Earth?s crust following the earthquake. These measurements will bear on a long-standing debate about mechanical properties and strength of rocks comprising the lower crust and upper mantle beneath Tibet. We will compare and contrast the observed deformation due to the 2015 Gorkha earthquake with observations from other large events in the region, in particular the 2005 Kashmir (Pakistan) earthquake. This will result in better understanding of seismic hazards in Nepal and surrounding areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 Gorkha earthquake was well imaged by the recently launched Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) missions, such as ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1. Short revisit times and wide-swath coverage of new operating satellites will allow measurements of postseismic deformation due to a major shallow thrust earthquake in unprecedented details. We will use coseismic radar interferograms from different lines of sight to derive a well-constrained finite slip model of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Because the earthquake epicentral area is characterized by a highly variable relief, we will evaluate the effects of topography by comparing results of inversions assuming elastic half-space, and finite element models that explicitly account for topography. These models will also accurately account for the 3-D elastic structure of the crust, as inferred from seismic tomography data. We will process and analyze a rich 2-year-long catalog of radar acquisitions in the earthquake area, generate time series of postseismic deformation, and combine available InSAR and GPS data to investigate the mechanisms of postseismic relaxation. Data and modeling results generated under the auspices of this project will be made available to a wider research community.</AbstractNarration>

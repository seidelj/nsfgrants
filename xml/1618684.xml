<AbstractNarration>Living in an age when services are often rated, people are increasingly depending on reputation of sellers or products/apps when making purchases online. This puts pressure on people to gain and maintain a high reputation by offering reliable and high-quality services and/or products, which benefits the society at large. Unfortunately, due to extremely high competition in e-commerce or app stores, recently reputation manipulation related services have quickly developed into a sizable business, which is termed Reputation-Escalation-as-a-Service (REaaS). As REaaS attacks grow in scale, effective countermeasures must be designed to detect and defend against them.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research addresses REaaS from two aspects. First, it aims to understand the economics of  REaaS by conducting empirical studies of  e-markets. Second, it aims to develop defensive measures, which involve both technical approaches and market intervention.  The technical approaches focus on detection of REaaS from e-markets, and novel detection techniques will be developed using content analysis, machine learning, social ties, and graph theory. For market invention, after a holistic analysis of REaaS, this research aims to identify its bottleneck (the weakest link) and also measure the efficacy of intervention. The outcome of this data-driven security research will enhance security education with labs based on social-economic data analysis. The success of this research will attract more attention of industry practitioners, government sectors, and academia to jointly tackle the REaaS problem.</AbstractNarration>

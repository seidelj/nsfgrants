    <AbstractNarration>Infrared and solar radiation absorbed by atmospheric water and trace gases drives atmospheric chemistry and climate. Individual species absorb radiation in unique spectral bands and windows and the amounts vary with pressure and temperature for each molecule. In order to accurately compute the energy absorbed by our atmosphere and to use remote sensing to detect these molecules accurate line by line spectral absorption parameters including their variation with environmental parameters is needed. This research uses fundamental physics to construct accurate line shape parameters of key atmospheric species that will be used in atmospheric radiation and remote sensing retrieval models to advance our knowledge of atmospheric chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a unified theoretical framework to calculate pressure-broadened half-widths and pressure-induced line shifts, their velocity and temperature dependences for gases important in the Earth's atmosphere. The improved formalism will go beyond the current Voigt profile approximation to enhance remote sensing retrievals and line-by-line computations of radiative forcing of climate. The research will develop the new Hartmann-Tran profiles that require velocity dependent line shape parameters that will be estimated from thousands of ro-vibronic transitions that will be computed using ab initio and Modified Complex Robert-Bonamy codes. It will target H2O, CO2, O3 and CH4 line broadening in collision with N2, O2, and self-collisions at atmospherically relevant temperatures and pressures. Specifically, the effects of line coupling and mixing on half-widths will be rigorously treated and calibrated using available observations. In addition to advancing the U.S. community HITRAN database focused studies will enrich remote sensing retrievals and radiative forcing by trace gases to advance atmospheric chemistry and climate.</AbstractNarration>

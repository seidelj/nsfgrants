    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation by mathematicians from the United States in the Sixth Workshop on Differential Geometry, which is being held near Cordoba, Argentina, August 1-5, 2016. The workshop brings together experts from around the world to present recent advances in differential geometry and to facilitate further progress on major open problems. A series of minicourses will expose participants to a broad spectrum of subdisciplines. The majority of the researchers who will receive travel support through the award will be graduate students, recent doctoral degree recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics. The minicourses and research lectures, as well as the opportunity to interact with participants from around the world, will help to broaden and deepen the research trajectories of junior participants. The workshop is the sixth in a series of workshops on differential geometry held in the environs of Cordoba, Argentina. These workshops have facilitated very fruitful and mutually beneficial collaborations between Argentine and U.S. researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will focus on applications of Lie transformation groups to several central areas of differential geometry, including geometric flows and solitons, holonomy and its applications, special geometric structures, and dynamics on Riemannian manifolds. The workshop will foster the cross-fertilization of ideas across these areas as well as facilitate new collaborations to advance research in each of the individual areas. Minicourses will address Kahler geometry, Yamabe invariants, calibrations and minimal volume submanifolds, Ricci solitons, spectral geometry, and dynamical aspects of geodesics.

    <AbstractNarration>1511791(Chelliah)/1511520(Cutler)/1510222(Edwards)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-speed and supersonic combustion is of vital importance to high-speed transport. The research team comprised of experimentalist and numerical modelers will try to understand, using a unique facility and state-of-art numerical models, how fuel burning at such high speed happens and how stable combustion can be achieved. A team of undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research and the data and results will be widely published. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand the flame stabilization mechanism requires the understanding flame structure resulting from the interaction between the chemical reaction, which releases heat, and the flow. Under high-speed conditions, the flow is turbulent. The proposal focuses on this interaction under supersonic conditions where compressibility also plays a role. The flow geometry chosen is high-speed reacting shear flow over cavity, which is commonly believed to be a good candidate for supersonic combustion and propulsion. The proposed facility (located at the lead PI's institution - UVa) is unique, which has been developed over the past decades and is well and appropriately leveraged for the proposed research. Fundamental data on flame structure and statistics on key species are to be obtained experimentally. Computational results using DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) will supplement the experiments to provide additional information not accessible from experiments in developing submodels, which can be used in the future development of high-speed propulsion combustors. The experimental data are of archival value. Close collaboration proposed with researchers from government labs would likely amplify its usefulness.</AbstractNarration>

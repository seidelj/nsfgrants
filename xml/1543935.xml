    <AbstractNarration>The ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing 2015 (SoCC 2015) is the sixth in an established series of symposia that bring together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing. As the premier conference on cloud computing, and through the continuous efforts of the community, the scope of SoCC is broad and encompasses diverse data management and systems topics such as software as a service, virtualization, scalable cloud data services, and data management and analytics at scale. Many facets of systems and data management issues must be revisited in the context of cloud computing. The goal of the proposed project is to help train and develop the future generation of leaders and workforce in the increasingly critical field of cloud computing and data services by supporting 15 students currently matriculated in US institutions for partial travel support and registration. The SoCC 2015 program includes research and industrial papers, poster sessions, and keynote talks by leaders in academia and industry. All these activities provide a unique opportunity for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research works with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry. In addition to meeting industry (such as such as Oracle, Microsoft, Google, IBM,Salesforce, WMWare, and Facebook, and others) leaders during regular program sessions, this year students will also be able to will also actively participate in a new interactive activity, titled "Vis-a-vis Meeting with Leading Researchers." These opportunities will have a long lasting impact on the future career of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will be co-located with VLDB 2015 and will be held in Kohala Coast, Hawaii. Efforts to reduce student registration fees have been made; however, supporting students to take advantage of the great benefits offered at ACM SoCC 2015 enables greater student interaction opportunities and a higher educational impact. The intellectual merit of the project will include opportunity for students to showcase their research results, get feedback on their works in progress, learn about the cutting edge research conducted by others, and interact with experts at a premier cloud computing conference. the broader impact of the project will include helping train the future generation of researchers and workforce in the increasingly critical field of cloud computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web site at: http://acmsocc.github.io/2015/index.html</AbstractNarration>

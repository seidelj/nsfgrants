<AbstractNarration>Manchester University (MU) will develop the "STEM Pathways Academy", a project to increase the number of students pursuing STEM degrees and the number of professionals in STEM fields. MU will recruit two cohorts of ten academically talented and financially needy first year students majoring in biology, biology-chemistry, or chemistry. Students will experience pedagogical enhancements that engage them in early research, STEM career-focused seminars, tiered mentoring, and opportunities for career exploration. Successful elements of the project will be disseminated to promote strategies that positively impact the retention and success of students in STEM, ultimately increasing the number and diversity of STEM professionals in the field.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The STEM Pathways Academy will recruit two cohorts of students. These students will experience enhanced curricular components, a tiered mentoring program, and a career-focused seminar series. The curricular enhancements will include problem-based learning, teaching with case studies, flipped classrooms and real-world research projects in classes and labs. The tiered mentoring model will include four levels of mentoring: peers, faculty, industry professionals and alumni. The career-focused seminar courses will involve career exploration, industry and graduate school site visits, and graduate school and career preparation. Project goals will include increased retention (target: 90%), graduation (target: 85% within five years), and postsecondary success in STEM careers or advanced study (target: 100% of graduating scholars). MU will evaluate and advance practices like tiered mentoring and integrated exposure to career options, investigating how these approaches affect STEM career selection and persistence.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>1644339 ?Payne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF has made an award in support of travel for invited speakers (5) and graduate students (5) coming from the United States to attend a Biophysical Society Thematic Meeting "Single Cell Biophysics: Measurement, Modulation, and Modeling" being held at the National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, June 17-20, 2017. Speakers (30 total) will come from the United States, Asia and Europe. Students will be selected for short presentations and presented travel awards based on abstracts submitted in response to an invitation posted in the Biophysical Society newsletter. Five student awardees will likewise be selected from Taiwan. The meeting focuses on one of the grand challenges of biophysics: how to understand the complexity of a single cell, which is multi-scale in time and space. The meeting brings together engineers and scientists for the purpose of discussing experimental, computational and theoretical advances in the single cell biophysics field. Topics include advances in single-molecule, single-cell and tissue imaging, dynamics and spatial organizations of cellular structures and processes, responses of cells to three-dimensional microenvironments, new experimental and computational methods for single cell analyses, and the interaction of cells with materials. The meeting provides a unique opportunity for participants from the US to interact with participants from Europe (e.g., Sweden, Spain, Switzerland and Great Britain) and Asia (e.g., Taiwan, China, Korea, Japan and Singapore).  Results from this workshop, in the form of a report, will be published in the Biophysical Society newsletter and made available on their website.</AbstractNarration>

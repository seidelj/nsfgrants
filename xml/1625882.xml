    <AbstractNarration>Through the acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer with extended spectral ranges and optical cryostat, this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports and enhances the research and educational capabilities at Ramapo College of New Jersey (RCNJ), a predominantly undergraduate institution. The instrument will enable several research activities pursued by one tenure-track and one tenured faculty at RCNJ. These activities include optical spectroscopy studies of: (a) spintronics materials, aimed at manipulating the spin of electrons in technological applications such as high-speed electronics, high volume storage or quantum computing; (b) hard coating ceramic thin films for use in space and nuclear applications; and (c) monolayer thin films of functional polymers, which play an important role in different technologies, including liquid-liquid extraction, stabilization of emulsions, and formation of supramolecular structures by self-assembly. The FTIR spectrometer will also provide research and training opportunities for a significant number of undergraduate students majoring in engineering physics, chemistry, biochemistry and biology, will increase the enrollment in the Research Honors course supported by the college, and will attract more undergraduate students in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Measurements of optical reflectance (and/or transmittance) over a wide spectral range (from THz to VIS/UV) allows extraction of optical properties such as dielectric function, optical conductivity, loss function, refractive index, and extinction coefficient. In turn, these optical parameters provide critical insight into the electronic band structure and electronic transport properties, as well as into the chemical structure and lattice dynamics of materials. The FTIR spectrometer, with additional capabilities, will enable several research activities, including: (a) temperature dependent optical spectroscopy on single crystals of bulk Dirac fermions and bulk Rashba semiconductors. The goals are to advance the understanding of the origin of bulk Dirac band dispersion, and to provide a reliable experimental procedure for determining the bulk Rashba parameters in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling; (b) effects of ion-irradiation on hard coatings of ceramic thin films. This research aims to utilize optical spectroscopy as a non-destructive tool for assessing the effects of irradiation on crystal and chemical structures of ceramic thin films; (c) direct structural measurements of the orientation of functional groups in polymer films. The main goal is to further the understanding of the structure and orientation of polymers and proteins in mixed monolayer films.</AbstractNarration>

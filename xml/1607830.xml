<AbstractNarration>Three-manifolds are objects modeled on the three-dimensional space that we are living in.  A doughnut and the spatial universe are both examples of three-manifolds. These objects arise naturally in many contexts in physical and other natural sciences and model many interesting phenomena. A geometric way of studying them is to cut a complicated three-manifold into simpler three-dimensional pieces along two-dimensional surfaces. For example, a so-called Heegaard splitting is such a decomposition. One can also use a technique known as surgery on a three-manifold that replaces a geometric piece with a different one. In this project, the PI plans to study various questions on three-manifolds using Heegaard splitting and surgery. The research targets several central questions in low-dimensional topology and knot theory, which has potential impact on other areas of scientific investigations, such as the topological structures of DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PI plans to study topology of three-manifolds. The first part of the research is to study a long-standing conjecture concerning Heegaard genus and degree-one map. The conjecture can be translated into a study of how Heegaard genus changes under a special type of surgeries and the PI plans to study such surgeries. The PI also plans to study several related questions on Heegaard genus of certain amalgamated three-manifolds. The second part of the project is to explore a new approach to proving the Berge Conjecture. This approach is inspired by the PI's observation that if there is a certain intersection pattern, then one can perform a stabilization and then an unstabilization, changing a Heegaard splitting of a knot exterior (in a lens space) into a meridionally primitive splitting. The PI plans to develop new tools and use techniques from his previous work to achieve these goals.</AbstractNarration>

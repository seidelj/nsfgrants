    <AbstractNarration>Quantum information science offers the possibility of creating new tools to develop a perfectly secure communication network. The past decade has seen numerous promising proof-of-principle demonstrations of components for quantum networks based on light using a variety of platforms including bulk materials, optical fibers, and more recently, photonic chips. To satisfy the scaling, robustness, and cost requirements necessary to enable pervasive implementation of quantum information technology, a platform compatible with silicon electronics is essential. However, it is becoming clear from current advances in chip-based photonic technology that no single material will be able to provide all the functionalities necessary to build a full scale quantum network. The approach proposed here to realize this vision of a fully integrated, practical, robust, and scalable quantum network is a novel three-dimensional heterogeneous photonic platform in which each material layer or a combination of coupled layers offers optimal performance for a specific functionality, such as controllably producing single-photons or storing information contained by the photons. Realization of this platform would provide the optimal characteristics from each material to achieve a high performance, fully integrated quantum photonic chip and to apply it to a quantum communication demonstration. In addition, the team will pursue broader impact efforts that include outreach to underrepresented groups through the Johns Hopkins University Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Achievement in the Baltimore Elementary Schools program, deliver lectures and lab demos at the Fair Haven Middle School bilingual science class in New Haven, and mentor freshman underrepresented Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics students through the Stevens Technical Enrichment Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The past decade has seen numerous promising photonic devices for quantum information in various platforms including bulk geometries, optical fibers, and more recently, photonic chips. To satisfy the scaling, robustness, and cost requirements necessary to enable pervasive implementation of quantum communication technology, a silicon-compatible platform is essential. Nevertheless, it is becoming clear from current advances in chip-based photonic technology that no single material will be able to provide all the functionalities necessary to build a full scale quantum network. To realize this vision a novel three-dimensional heterogeneous photonic platform is proposed in which each material layer or a combination of coupled layers offers optimal performance for a specific functionality such as indistinguishable single-photon sources, quantum frequency conversion, and quantum storage. This platform provides the optimal characteristics from each material that will allow the realization of a high performance, fully integrated quantum photonic chip and its application to a quantum communication demonstration. The first layer consists of silicon-nitride, which is readily deposited via chemical vapor deposition and exhibits the lowest propagation losses of any integrated photonic material. The second layer consists of a crystalline silicon that is reserved primarily for the silicon electronics that serve the quantum optical devices on the chip as well as opto-electronic devices such as electro-optic modulators. The third layer is hydrogenated amorphous silicon, which has the highest nonlinearity of any integrated photonic material. The last layer will be reserved for non-complimentary-metal-oxide semiconductor materials such as lithium niobate for upconversion photon detection and nonlinear optical Bell-state measurements. Ultimately, these components will be combined to realize a fully integrated quantum photonic chip that will be used in a quantum communication fiber testbed.</AbstractNarration>

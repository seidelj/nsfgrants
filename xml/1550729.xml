    <AbstractNarration>Enhancing Access to the Radio Spectrum (EARS) is a multi-disciplinary activity whose goal is to improve the efficiency with which the radio spectrum is utilized and to improve access to the radio spectrum in support of current and new technologies. Achieving these goals will, among other impacts, improve the availability of wireless broadband to Americans presently without broadband access. Because the radio spectrum is a valuable but finite natural resource, improvements in spectrum efficiency will have significant economic impact to the nation and the world. Building upon the NSF EARS research program, this invitational workshop will bring together some of the key researchers and other stakeholders involved in radio spectrum access to discuss the state of current research and policy in this area, and chart a course forward for research and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All relevant fields will be represented, including science, engineering, economics, and policy. Key federal agencies with stakes in wireless spectrum management and usage will be invited as well. The output of the workshop will include a vision for the future of radio spectrum access and use, and a prioritized list of research areas that can help achieve that vision.</AbstractNarration>

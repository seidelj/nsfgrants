    <AbstractNarration>A key challenge in advancing clean power technologies is solving the energy storage problem. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) award prepares graduate and undergraduate students in mechanical engineering at University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) to be globally engaged in research on combustion of metals as recyclable zero-carbon fuels. Three cohorts of UTEP students will be immersed in teams of faculty, post-doctoral researchers, and graduate students at McGill University, accessing cutting-edge laboratories and mentors that will expand their research skills and networks. The project aim is to inspire, recruit, and retain students from the remote Southwest border region pursuing careers in areas related to combustion, energy, and the environment. These UTEP students will develop science communication and outreach skills as they share their research with diverse audiences including local El Paso high school students. The project will benefit society by advancing clean energy research and broadening STEM participation in research challenges of national and global importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to give U.S. students, including many Hispanic and women students, international research experiences focused on clean energy carriers using unique facilities and techniques under the mentorship of highly qualified Canadian researchers. The three cohorts of graduate and undergraduate students will be prepared to spend twelve weeks during summer in research teams at McGill University. Their research projects will be focused on the use of metals as recyclable fuels that can be produced with clean primary energy and burned to produce heat and power at high energy and power densities. Students will continue their profession development after return to the U.S. and remain connected to their international research community through a social network site. The project will help establish long-term sustainable collaboration, which will lead to new projects, internationals student exchanges, and scientific publications in the area of combustion for clean energy applications.</AbstractNarration>

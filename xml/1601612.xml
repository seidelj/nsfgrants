    <AbstractNarration>There is strong evidence that the targeted use of interactive instructional content creates an immersive, non-linear environment that engages students and improves learning and understanding. The project advances the creation and adoption of interactive instructional materials within the ATE community simultaneously providing students engaging, interactive content and addressing spiraling textbook costs. Workshops and a self-paced online course will train educators to create interactive content using free and relatively inexpensive tools and empower them to develop their own interactive, immersive and engaging learning elements and share what they have learned and developed with colleagues and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will positively impact teaching and learning by infusing interactivity with purpose to help students grasp difficult concepts and increase the number of students successfully completing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs. Existing NSF centers and projects and industry contributors will be solicited to provide content for interactive materials and review the materials developed. Significant efforts will also be made to engage faculty and institutions that serve underrepresented populations. Collaboration with five ATE national centers will impact a significant number of students and faculty, including the participating subject matter experts (SMEs) and their students as well as colleges, high schools and individual faculty associated with these centers and the ATE community at-large. Underrepresented populations will be reached through existing outreach efforts of these partners, face-to-face workshops at predominantly minority-serving institutions and via promotion of the self-paced online course to organizations, publications and social media connected with educators and institutions that serve traditionally underrepresented populations.</AbstractNarration>

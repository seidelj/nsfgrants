    <AbstractNarration>1622770&lt;br/&gt;Mihelcic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wastewater is considered a valuable resource that can provide sources of water, energy, and nutrients. However, innovators in the water sectors commonly cite a lack of access to test facilities as an impediment to the development of innovative technologies that can help address water infrastructure challenges. Recent workshop reports, including the Energy-Positive Water Resource Recovery Workshop and the Intensification in Resource Recovery Workshop recommended that government, academia, nongovernmental organizations, technology vendors, and municipal treatment facilities collaborate to form a national network of test bed facilities to advance the pace of innovation in this area. Achieving the vision of an impactful National Water Resource Recovery Facility Test Bed Network will support efforts to translate innovative technologies to practice that promote sustainability and resource recovery from wastewater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help advance the creation of an impactful national test bed network that promotes the translation of innovative technologies for resource recovery from wastewater into a national research space that engages academic, industrial, and municipal partners. A national test bed network is expected to attract creative ideas and talents by engaging a wide range of partners for the progression of basic research into new innovations. The test bed network will also foster innovation among faculty and students, promote regional coordination and linkages, and develop technology-based networks of researchers. A test bed network should also serve as an "engine of innovation" and help to extend the Nation's historical reputation for ingenuity. To successfully encourage innovation, a test bed network should make a meaningful difference in shortening the timeline of moving products into the marketplace. It should also reduce costs of product development. This workshop's primary objective is to define key metrics that new technologies evaluated at the national test bed network should measure and report. A second workshop objective is to determine whether or not a central reporting system to share data on innovative technologies in a national test bed network is necessary and achievable. If so, the participants will set the preliminary design conditions for such a reporting system. The workshop will consist of approximately 50 professionals that can include researchers from universities, utility research programs, and national laboratories. In addition, it will also host technology providers, entrepreneurs, and water sector venture capitalists, members of WERF's LIFT program, NSF's SBIR program, and other utility managers interested in fostering innovation, engineering consultants, and federal officials from EPA, DOE, NSF, USDA, and other interested agencies. It is expected that a national test bed network devoted to recovering valuable resources from wastewater will lead to environmental, economic, and social benefits from enhanced innovation capacity. Four supported positions are set aside for early career scientists (senior doctoral students and post-doctoral research associates) and the program committee has plans to achieve appropriate representation of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

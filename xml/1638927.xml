    <AbstractNarration>According to a USDA summary circa 2015, there exist 2.08 million farms in the US, spanning a total of 913 million acres with an average farm size of 438 acres. Efficiency and productivity are integral factors in profitability from agricultural operations. Efficiency and productivity critically depend on the level of automation or semi-automation, continuous real-time monitoring, continuous and timely intervention, and our ability to benefit from emerging scientific and technological innovations (e.g. low-cost and high-precision sensors, wireless technologies, etc). As part of previous NSF funded research, this I-Corps team has pioneered efficient localization algorithms for wireless sensor networks. The algorithms offer computational speed and real-time localization accuracy. Motivated by the broader impacts of these algorithms, the team is now interested in evaluating their commercial and technological potential to increase efficiency and productivity in American agriculture. This NSF I-Corps project and its potential outcomes are expected to be of high interest to the US Department of Agriculture. Potential customers include (1) Large agricultural companies; (2) Manufacturers of precision agriculture equipment; (3) Precision farming service providers; and most importantly (4) American farmers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF I-Corps project will enable the team to better understand the market needs for an "electronic localization system," identify competing precision farming solutions, and build a demonstrable prototype. The proposed hardware consists of an array of sensor nodes with calibration and measurement capabilities (e.g. moisture, nitric oxide, sodium, temperature, etc.) that can be deployed throughout a given farmland. Software consists of data fusion and data-2-decision algorithms developed via our previously funded NSF technology (i.e. localization of a node). Functionally, each node is capable of detecting anomalies (e.g. high temperature and low moisture) and sending alert signals to the base station. The system alerts the farmer (or an autonomous vehicle) and offers precise localization and navigation to the concerned site for executing real-time remedial measures. The technology aims to eliminate dependence on global positioning systems (GPS), thereby offering a cost-effective precision farming solution for many rural environments where GPS is either undependable or unavailable. In this proposed I-Corps project, the team will (1) Interact with potential clients; (2) Investigate market needs and market size; (3) Learn about the supply chain and distribution channels; and (4) Talk to potential venture investors about what kind of precision agriculture innovations would be attractive for investment.</AbstractNarration>

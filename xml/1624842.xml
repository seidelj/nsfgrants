    <AbstractNarration>Phase I I/UCRC Arizona State University Site: Center for Efficient Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation Systems (EV-STS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University (ASU) will help establish and operate a multi-institution Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Efficient Vehicles and Sustainable Transportation Systems (EV-STS) as one of two charter sites (University of Louisville will host the other charter site). Such a center is needed to support the U.S. automotive/ground transportation industry?s efforts to meet demanding new federal regulations governing vehicle fuel economy and emissions, as well as society?s expectations for improved sustainability in economic and personal activities. The EV-STS center will engage the industry?s critical stakeholders - vehicle manufacturers, component and system suppliers, fleet operators, ground transportation industry infrastructure providers, and state and local governments - in identifying important efficiency/sustainability related problems, and formulating a research program that develops innovative solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the EV-STS center and its ASU site is to leverage collaborations among corporate, government, and academic partners to conduct and disseminate industry-relevant research on technologies and tools that facilitate the design, manufacture, deployment, and operation of energy efficient, environmentally sustainable ground vehicles. The scope of this mission includes passenger cars, light- and heavy duty trucks, and motorized off-road equipment. It encompasses both vehicle-level technologies, and the infrastructure and transportation systems that incorporate ground vehicles. The mission is divided into four primary thrust areas: powertrains for full-electric vehicles and the entire continuum of electric-hybrid powertrains, including batteries, electric machines, power electronics, thermal management, packaging, etc., advanced internal combustion engines and alternative fuels, non-powertrain vehicle systems, and ground transportation systems and infrastructure. Within EV-STS the ASU site will have a research focus on realizing sustainable electrified vehicles. Site-specific topic areas are likely to include power electronics, power electronics device, system integration, and materials and processes for integration for vehicle-connected wearable health monitoring electronics for driver safety and overall transportation system safety.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This project supports a workshop that explores issues related to developing an introductory engineering course sequence that ensures that the requisite skills in science and mathematics are met while developing relevancy, expertise, and ownership of the student. The workshop convenes approximately 40 participants from groups who have different roles in the support in the successful entry of underrepresented students into higher education and the engineering workforce. The workshop facilitates discussion, community building, and sharing of best practices among experts from across the social, education (middle and high schools and higher education), engineering, business/government, and policy making communities. The broader impact of this project is the focus on broadening the participation in engineering by supporting pathways to success for underrepresented groups in urban areas, including African American students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the workshop are to: 1) identify the challenges and the potential ways to identify the critical aptitude and efficacy performance indicators for recruitment and monitoring of students to enter into a pre-engineering course sequence, 2) identify the challenges and the potential ways to identify the outcomes, performance indicators, modalities and the timeline associated with a pre-engineering course sequence, and 3) develop recommendations for pathways and models for the sustainability of such efforts. Workshop participants are engaged through pre-workshop readings and materials, interactive sessions during the workshop, and follow up interactions after the workshop. Issues related to models for transferable credit to engineering programs for academic work in secondary and post-secondary settings also are considered. A focused evaluation plan that includes interviews and surveys to document the impacts of the project.</AbstractNarration>

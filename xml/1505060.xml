    <AbstractNarration>A rising tide of calls for improved science education underscores the importance and significance of incorporating stronger training of scientific thinking skills into first-year college science courses. This project addresses that need by developing, evaluating, and disseminating a set of scientific thinking teaching materials with proven efficacy in a variety of college settings. The materials will use core topics in Introductory Psychology in combination with real world issues and controversies to train students' scientific thinking skills. The project builds on cognitive psychology research on human learning and established best-practices for science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goals of the project are to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a set of flexible, research-based teaching modules to improve the training of scientific literacy and quantitative reasoning skills in Introductory Psychology. The project will develop a set of scientific thinking instructional modules, keyed to the major topics covered in Introductory Psychology. A unique element of the project is its intentionally collaborative framework, which involves a network of faculty from four academic sites in Oregon including two community colleges (CCs), a large four-year Research 1 institution (R1), and a selective, liberal arts undergraduate college (SLAC). This inter-institutional network will collaborate on the development and formative assessment of all resources, including identifying adaptations of modules for different course formats and student needs. A comprehensive assessment plan will provide a summative assessment of the effectiveness of the teaching modules at all three institution types (CC/R1/SLAC) prior to broader dissemination to the psychology teaching community.</AbstractNarration>

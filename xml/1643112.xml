<AbstractNarration>The project STAMPS: Science, Technology and Math Preparation Scholarships is serving the national interest by supporting academically talented and financially needy students, including minority, women and first-generation college students, in their efforts to complete their college degrees in the STEM disciplines (Natural, Physical, Earth and Computer Sciences). The project is providing financial, academic, mentoring and advising support to talented students in the STEM disciplines to increase their retention rates and better prepare students for science and technology-based careers or for advance study in professional (e.g., medical, dental, pharmacy, graduate) schools. By doing so, the project is increasing the pool of talented individuals for highly skilled jobs or careers in science and technology. The project is also developing best practices on how to support and train students for a skilled workforce that is shared with other universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STAMPS enrolls a diverse group of first year STEM students into a yearlong integrated science course, designed to create a cohort, supported by faculty and peer mentors and services. STAMPS students have opportunities for research, interacting with STEM speakers, travel, and facilitated shadowing at the Joint School for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering. The goals are to 1) matriculate and then graduate STAMPS scholars into STEM careers or graduate school; 2) identify and support a diverse community of STEM learners; 3) create a supportive and self-sustaining environment for STAMPS scholars; and 4) discover what works and why and share this knowledge to a broad audience.</AbstractNarration>

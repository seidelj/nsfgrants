    <AbstractNarration>This project creates and I-Corps Site at Wichita State University (WSU).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WSU I-Corps Site project goals are to:&lt;br/&gt;(1)Synchronize a synergistic research and innovation ecosystem to more rapidly translate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and technologies into new and existing business and industry,&lt;br/&gt;(2)Strengthen and further develop WSU research and industry collaborations, &lt;br/&gt;(3)Enhance the educational environment increasing understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship, and &lt;br/&gt;(4)Leverage STEM discoveries and innovations to increase U.S. competitiveness and create jobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WSU I-Corps Site program supports entrepreneurial students, faculty, and researchers and strategically equips them to accelerate their ideas, research, processes and products into market-driven commercial applications, profitable enterprises, and start-up companies, and/or toward becoming I-Corps Team applicants. The support includes infrastructure, guidance, resources, networking opportunities, training, and funding to enable WSU innovators and I-Corps Site Teams to mature and commercialize their ideas and spur the development of 21st century jobs and industries. Project outcomes include development of investor-ready business models, direct commercialization of technology, business start-ups, licensing agreements, and increased applications submitted by WSU Site Teams to the NSF's I-Corps Team Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps Site activities expand on the university's existing strengths, creating momentum to spur increased engagement with student and faculty, increasing the pipeline of innovations from the university, increasing interaction and engagement with local entrepreneurial mentors, and promoting entrepreneurial and commercial thinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts for this Site include expanded development of a more diversified innovation ecosystem model that can be applied in other geographic regions. The additional knowledge gained from targeted entrepreneurship curriculum enables the WSU innovation ecosystem to attract and promote student and faculty innovations and research to improve the advanced manufacturing cluster, with particular focus on unrepresented groups (minorities, female, lower income populations). Entrepreneurial training/educational modules embed the entrepreneurial concepts into STEM and other innovation activities. Societal and economic impacts include enhancing and strengthening the Midwest innovation ecosystem, and contributing to stronger technology-based economic development in Kansas, job creation and retention, wealth creation, healthier work environment, student education, venture capital investment, and business start-ups and expansions.</AbstractNarration>

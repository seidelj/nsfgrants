    <AbstractNarration>This award will support attendance by early career researchers at the 18th Rust Belt RNA Meeting Ciliate Molecular Biology Conference to be held at the Marriott Hotel Downtown in Cleveland, OH on October 14-15, 2016. The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings. A number of activities are aimed at professional development and mentoring for early career scientists. There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for networking. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ever-increasing impact of RNA science has been fueled by its immense potential to shed light on a wide array of important problems ranging from the origin of life to the molecular basis of inter-cellular communication. Some of these advances will be among the topics featured in the scientific sessions, which will include: biosynthesis, processing and export of RNA; translation and RNA decay; RNA-RNA and RNA-Protein interactions; and RNA in disease, health and biotechnology. Results will be disseminated by publication of abstracts on the meeting website.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator proposes to investigate the boiling phenomenon (much like boiling in a pan) when the surface temperature is exceedingly higher than boiling temperature. The result has many industrial applications including cooling powerful computer and supercomputer devices. The PI will also use liquids other than water that are commonly used in industrial cooling. Graduate students will be involved in the research activities. The PI will expand his current work with students in the 6th grade class from Franklin Roosevelt Middle School from the Rochester city school district serving minority and underprivileged students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaporation of liquid film sandwiched between the vapor bubble and the solid surface (i.e., the meniscus) is responsible for the phase change. The PI will perform experiments, simulations and analytical studies on an evaporating meniscus in a pressure-controlled environment with three liquids and on different surfaces. The PI proposes boiling conditions up to CHF (critical heat flux) conditions. The intended results will provide quantitative data on (a) transient film thickness by capturing laser interference fringes at high temporal resolutions, (b) high-resolution transient thermal response of the underlying heater surface, and (c) contact angle and interface modulation with high speed imaging. The proposed tasks are important and provide high-quality data that have been rarely obtained, by using high-speed optical methods with high resolutions (50,000 frames per second), while using a combined analytical and numerical method to help elucidate the physics and heat transfer mechanism in the meniscus region.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Ren&lt;br/&gt;1624219&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wastewater treatment plants are transforming the current energy intensive, regulatory focused operations into integrated energy and resource recovery facilities, or "Energy-Positive Water Resource Recovery Facilities" (EPWRRF). The energy content embedded in wastewater is multiple times the energy used for treatment, and value-added resources can be recovered as well. However, the lack of access to test facilities for technology development and implementation is a major impediment for this transformation. This workshop will focus on evaluation metrics for technologies and the structure and general functions for a potential test bed network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent workshops on energy-positive water resource recovery, organized collaboratively by federal agencies, academic institutions, industry groups, and water utilities, paved a pathway toward the water resource recovery facilities of the future. The energy content (heat and chemical) embedded in wastewater is multiple times the energy used for treatment, and value-added resources such as nutrients, precious metals, chemicals, and clean water can be recovered as well at such facilities. The most pressing the finding of these recent workshops and activities was the hindrance of new technology adoption due to the lack of test-bed facilities for wastewater technologies. The objective of this workshop focuses on envisioning the structure of a test bed network and specific action plans to assist with technology transfer from laboratory benchtops all the way through demonstration and deployment. The participants from different fields will discuss the following major questions: 1) What will the testbeds look like? 2) How can a testbed network be built? 3) How will different projects will enter the testing pipeline? 4) How can environmental compliance be assured? 5) How can successful demonstrations be translated to the market place? 6) What are the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the projects and testbed network? EPWRRFs are an excellent way to address "tipping points" in the food-water-energy nexus by lowering energy usage at water treatment plants, by recovering valuable resources required by agriculture and other industries, and by providing clean water for both potable and non-potable uses. Enabling these new technologies to transfer to the marketplace is key to solving water quality issues as well as food and energy sustainability problems.</AbstractNarration>

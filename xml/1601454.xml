<AbstractNarration>U.S. manufacturing competiveness relies on workers trained in advanced manufacturing technologies. This project focuses on the use of cobots in advanced manufacturing systems, and aims to develop critical industry-driven, hands-on learning content for cobot technicians, engineering technologists, and robotic automation teachers and faculty. Cobots, or collaborative robots, are safe and flexible enough to operate in the vicinity of and harmoniously with human operators. With a predicted 150,000 cobots to be installed worldwide in the next three years, cobots will become standard practice in advanced manufacturing systems and will cause manufacturers to re-evaluate traditional barriers between human, semi-automated, and automated tasks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oakland Community College Department of Engineering, Manufacturing, and Industrial Technology (OCC-EMIT) and the Wayne State University Division of Engineering Technology and Industrial and Systems Engineering Department (WSU-DET) will: (1) develop a cobot  course and create an industry-based cobot laboratory at OCC-EMIT to educate community college students and develop their cobot skills and competencies; (2) develop a two-day cobot short course at WSU-DET to teach community college instructors advanced cobot topics; (3) develop and deliver seminars for community college faculty, secondary STEM teachers, and industry professionals to broaden cobot awareness; and (4) establish articulation agreements to create a pathway for OCC-EMIT students to continue cobot education at WSU-DET. Evaluation and assessment activities will be used to measure the effectiveness of the cobot learning program. The deliverables of this project include comprehensive educational material for STEM secondary teachers, community college and university faculty to educate  manufacturing workers in cobot technology.  Cobot learning modules, materials, seminars, short-course, and labs will be disseminated through  OCC-EMIT and WSU-DET websites and will be available for distance learning and industry-based training.</AbstractNarration>

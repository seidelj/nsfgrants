    <AbstractNarration>Proposal 1550387&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ECCS: Student Travel for the 18th International conference on Solid State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems &lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert Candler.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transducers 2015, the 18th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators, and Microsystems, will be held from June 21st through June 25th, 2015 in Anchorage Alaska. The meeting will include participants from academia, industry, and government research entities. The conference will create an atmosphere for open discussion of recent research results through oral and poster presentations. As in previous years, the Transducers conference will continue to provide a student-centered platform for research discussions, providing graduate students a large number of opportunities to present and discuss their research. Funding is being requested from the National Science Foundation to support travel costs for graduate student presenters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators, and Microsystems provides an immersive technical experience for attendees, showcasing major technological, scientific and commercial breakthroughs in mechanical, optical, chemical&lt;br/&gt;and biological devices and systems using micro and nanotechnology. The 18th session of this meeting, commonly called "Transducers", will be chaired by Prof. Tom Kenny, who has 25 years experience in the MEMS community. The technical program includes&lt;br/&gt;world-renowned plenary and invited speakers, as well as sessions for peer-reviewed oral and poster presentations. Transducers will continue its tradition of being a student focused conference, where a large majority of the presentations are given by graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and postdoctoral scholars. This award will support the travel of graduate students? to attend the conference and meet top speakers on the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support from this award will result in several graduate students attending this meeting Transducers 2015. The areas of the conference MEMS/NEMS and transducers are very important areas for the current technology. The impact of this award will be as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Opportunities for a diverse group of graduate student researchers to interact with&lt;br/&gt;senior members of the research community, broadening their scientific&lt;br/&gt;perspective and promoting their career development&lt;br/&gt;(2) Enhance understanding of the science that underpins the development of&lt;br/&gt;micro/nanoscale sensors, actuators, and microsystems&lt;br/&gt;(3) Foster and promote long-term relationships between researchers in diverse fields&lt;br/&gt;including bioengineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering,&lt;br/&gt;electrical engineering, chemistry, and physics&lt;br/&gt;(4) Promote the development of multidisciplinary teams that can address difficult&lt;br/&gt;problems using micro- and Nano-technologies by exposing the conference&lt;br/&gt;attendees to a broad range of micro/nanoscale scientific advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the description of the topics that will be covered in Transducers meeting 2015, the intent is to support large number of students to participate in the conference , as well as the specific purpose of the funds to support students travel, we recommend that this proposal be funded in the requested amount of $15,000. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mona Zaghloul&lt;br/&gt;Program Director ECCS/CCSS</AbstractNarration>

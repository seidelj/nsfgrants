    <AbstractNarration>This is funding to support this year's CSCW doctoral research consortium (workshop) of approximately 12-14 promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with 4-6 distinguished research faculty. The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2016 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, to be held in San Francisco, CA, on February 27-March 2, and sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI). The CSCW conferences are a premier venue for the presentation of research relating to the research, design and practice of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities and networks (including collaborative systems and social computing), and are attended by approximately 500 professionals from around the world, top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry who are interested in both the technical and social aspects of collaboration. The development and application of new technologies continues to enable new ways of working together and coordinating activities. Although work is an important area of focus for the conference, technology is increasingly supporting a wide range of social activities. CSCW has also embraced an increasing range of devices, as we collaborate from different contexts and situations. CSCW 2016 will be the 19th conference in the series. Research reports published in the CSCW Conference Proceedings are heavily refereed and widely cited. More information about the conference may be found online at http://cscw.acm.org/2016/index.php. The CSCW doctoral consortia, which began in 1992, have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars, and many of today's leading CSCW researchers participated as students in earlier consortia. These doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of CSCW researchers, allowing them both to sharpen the research skills and to create a social network among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Maintaining and fostering research dialog among the diverse disciplines that are present in the CSCW community results in synergistic and transformative research collaborations. Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctoral Colloquium at CSCW 2016 will be a full-day event taking place on Sunday, February 29, preceded by an opening dinner and welcome activities the evening before. Follow-up activities (including poster sessions) will take place during the conference's main technical program. Goals of the doctoral consortium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field mentor them and provide constructive advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. Student participants, who are chosen by a review committee based on materials submitted by applicants in response to the CSCW Call for Participation, will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. The students' presentations will be published in the CSCW Extended Abstracts, which are available to all conference attendees. The organizing committee will take proactive steps to ensure and increase participation from institutions and ethnic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented at CSCW.</AbstractNarration>

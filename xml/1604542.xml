    <AbstractNarration>1604542&lt;br/&gt;Jun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fresh water demands of growing populations are driving the search for advanced membrane technologies for desalination and water reuse projects. The longevity of these membranes is strongly related to their resistance to fouling. In this work, the PIs will develop two new multifunctional membranes which have the potential to minimize fouling and, therefore, extend the lifetime of the membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed photothermally-active nanostructure-enabled reverse osmosis membranes are highly innovative, potentially transformative, and, quite promising for water treatment. For the first time, gold (Au) nanostars- and chemically exfoliated-MoS2-enabled photothermally-active membranes will be tested for their bactericidal efficacy as well as their inorganic and organic fouling resistance. In particular, this work investigates the unexplored potential of inexpensive and earth-abundant MoS2 as a replacement for expensive materials to achieve water sustainability. Because chemically exfoliated-MoS2 is a highly promising 2D optical and electronic material, new information about water chemically exfoliated-MoS2 interfacial reactions will also help design safer and more sustainable nanomaterials. Furthermore, the proposed research will elucidate scientific principles underlying the in situ nucleation and growth of gold (Au) nanostars and their photothermal effects on membranes. It will define the substrates and nanostructures surface chemistry (i.e., their chemical nature, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and morphology) in highly saline solutions. These lessons can also advance our understanding of the complex fouling behavior of other membrane systems. In addition, the wide array of nanoscale characterization techniques for nanostructures in solution and on substrate surfaces can lead to novel synthetic routes for size- and shape-controlled nanomaterials. Creating unique nanostructures that can be light-activated to maximize bactericidal functionality is an innovative and transformative approach towards addressing a major global challenge. The proposed teaching and outreach plan will provide educational and research opportunities for middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

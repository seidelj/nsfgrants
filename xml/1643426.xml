    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the conference Bay Area Optimization Meeting 2017: From Data to Decisions that will take place at the University California Davis, May 12-13, 2017. The meeting is the third event in the series of regional meetings, (San Francisco) Bay Area Optimization Meetings, held since 2014. The 2017 meeting is planned as a national meeting, with some international participation. Decision makers and policy analysts face increasing uncertainty, but also increasing availability of data and information. This conference brings together researchers from a variety of disciplines who work on mathematical methods that can be used to analyze large amounts of data and be applied to decision problems faced by government and industry. The diversity of participants of this conference will result in dissemination of mathematical ideas to a broad range of researchers that otherwise might not have been aware of state-of-the-art theories and methods. The participants include both theoretical and computational mathematicians who work on development of fundamentals of this discipline and experts in decision making in a variety of fields such as energy, defense, policy planning, and transportation, where the new methods will have impact. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will feature 15 world-experts in stochastic and variational analysis. The meeting will involve a large number of students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty who will participate in poster sessions and engage the speakers in technical discussions. The subject of the meeting lies at the intersection of equilibrium and optimization models for decision making and statistical models of learning, forecasting, and uncertainty quantification. The lectures and papers on timely issues will be made available to the mathematical sciences, management sciences, and engineering communities through publication in a special issue of the Mathematical Programming journal. Recorded lectures will be available through the conference website. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, and registration information, can be found at https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/bayopt2017</AbstractNarration>

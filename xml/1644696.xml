    <AbstractNarration>This project is from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and extends and expands their existing I-Corps Site for another three years. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request funding for up to five years. Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. These proposals may request funding for up to three years. UIUC's first Site award, funded in 2014, was highly successful. Many of their teams went on to the national I-Corps Program and many teams launched startups from their local Site. The PI and Co-PI have been not only been active in the National Innovation Network, they serve as catalysts for national activities and assist other Sites during their startups. The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign previous site has been exemplary. Their proposal documents their successes and includes additional features that did not exist in their original Site.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Transport of small molecules across biological membranes is essential for cells; it enables removal of waste from cells, replenishing of nutrients, and secretion of messenger molecules. Energy-independent transport is facilitated by protein pores and channels that often are selective for a particular cargo, and have defined width and surface charge. All known transmembrane pores are made of protein. In synthetic biology, there is a need to design new kinds of pores, suitable for moving one kind of cargo. In this collaborative project, investigators from the US (Arizona State University) and the UK (University College London) combine expertise from membrane nanopore research and DNA nanotechnology to generate novel versions of membrane pores that are similar in properties to protein pores but are made of DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project exploits the recent breakthrough on simple membrane-spanning DNA nanopores and build structurally and functionally advanced pores of tunable size, charge properties, and activity. DNA nanopores will be designed and constructed to enable the programmable tuning of pore diameter, charge selectivity, and stimulus-controlled activities. The DNA nanopores of predictable structures will be tailored for applications including the development of membrane compartments for light-triggered release of proteins useful in cell biological research, and enzymatic membrane nanoreactors for the localized activation of anti-cancer prodrugs.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Missing data is a problem that plagues every branch of empirical science. Sensors do not always work reliably, respondents do not fill out every question in the questionnaire, and medical patients are often unable to recall episodes, treatments or outcomes. This project attempts to recover information of interest from partially observed data by reasoning about the process that could have caused some data to be missing and others to be observed. Recent advances in graphical models and causal inference permit us to describe such processes formally and identify conditions under which recovery from missing data would be feasible and, if so, how. This project will focus on conditions in which recovery is deemed infeasible by available techniques. By learning to manage such conditions this research will benefit empirical research in a variety of fields, including machine learning, big data, epidemiology, statistics, economics, social science and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the proposed research is to develop computer systems capable of learning from incomplete data by encoding assumptions in a graphical causal model. Using such models we will identify conditions that facilitate (or prohibit) inference and learning. In particular, this research will develop effective procedures for determining whether unbiased estimates of statistical and causal relationships can be computed given incomplete data and whether assumptions that facilitate such estimability have testable implications. Additionally, it will generate bounds for those relationships that are proved to be inestimable. These will in turn lead to a theoretical understanding of what is possible and impossible under missing data conditions. Given the ubiquity of the missing data problem we believe this research will create new and important tools for all data-intensive sciences.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to make it possible to design wind farms with significantly higher power generation capacity (a 25 to 30 percent increase from existing designs). A comprehensive system of systems approach to wind farm design will be developed which addresses the concomitant pervasive uncertainty through, both mitigation and exploitation. We will build on existing work in the supporting technological areas of wake modeling, wind farm power generation modeling, economics modeling, and optimal design for computationally prohibitive multidisciplinary systems. The major research activities include: (i) optimization, design, and uncertainty propagation; (ii) economic modeling; (iii) development of product family approaches; (iv) developing and parameterizing power output model of wind turbine arrays; and (v) validation of models. Guidelines will be developed that will directly assist engineers, researchers, and investors in their pertinent decision-making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the unique approach to dealing with the uncertainty-ridden system and the system of system approach being developed here, can enable the scientific community to achieve a new level in addressing our current and future energy requirements. A unique interdisciplinary environment will be provided to students who are motivated by the grand challenge of achieving 20% electric power using wind by 2030, and by the desire to be prepared for green jobs in the context of a rapidly changing economic landscape. Periodic exchange visits by faculty members, graduate and undergraduate students between the two institutions (RPI and SU) will provide the students with unique preparations. A key anticipated benefit of the proposed research is the increased likelihood of reaching our critical goal of having 20% of our electricity come from wind energy by 2030, which is a high national priority.</AbstractNarration>

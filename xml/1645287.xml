<AbstractNarration>1645287&lt;br/&gt;Khan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development and applications of low-cost, portable air-quality sensors to measure gases and particulate pollutants has grown significantly in the past several years. This need is further elevated by poor and deteriorating air quality and related health concerns experienced in urban regions throughout the world, in both the developed and developing countries. This EAGER proposal aims at developing a citizen science program to study the impact of air-pollution, and, a basic understating of factors that influence local and regional air-quality by broad dissemination of sensor technology to the local communities and to the general public. A novel aspect of this air monitoring citizens science program is that it brings together various organizations, communities with diverse background of participants and volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor are the three of the most important greenhouse gases with impact on the radiative forcing on earth with diverse sources of emissions. Among several of the anthropogenic sources of emissions, a few are: fossil fuel combustion, agricultural soil management, landfills, and fugitive emissions from natural gas. Therefore, as a part of technological development part of this project the PI will design and develop a low-cost, portable, highly precise and user-friendly sensor porotypes to simultaneously measure carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide and water vapor. There are two goals of this program: 1. design and develop technologies that enable low-cost and user-friendly operation of air-quality monitoring sensors, and, 2. develop a comprehensive program to enhance environmental awareness by infusing these technologies to key stakeholders by partnering with local schools, environmental agencies and organizations in the state of Delaware. This air monitoring citizen science program involves several stakeholders and participants from local environmental agencies, local organizations, schools, hospitals and health services in the state of Delaware. The program will empower communities towards better understanding of tools and technologies of monitoring systems, basis understanding of air quality and pollution, and its local and global impact. Several components of citizens air monitoring program will integrate into current programs from partner organizations which includes school rain garden project, green buildings, vehicle ant-idling campaigns and awareness campaigns of impact of air quality on children?s health. Finally, the program will greatly enhance capacity and capabilities of Delaware State University, an HBCU institution, by developing innovative sensing technologies for low-cost, portable next-generation air monitoring sensors.</AbstractNarration>

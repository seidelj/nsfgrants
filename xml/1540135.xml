    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 28th Pacific Northwest Numerical Analysis Seminar (PNWNAS), held at Western Washington University, October 17, 2015. As an annual event for the past twenty-seven years, PNWNAS has become one of the primary means for local research groups in numerical computation to engage in scientific exchanges. With invited speakers from industry, government, and academia, PNWNAS 2015 will help keep its participants abreast of recent developments in the field of computational mathematics and numerical analysis, hence fostering research interactions and further promoting mathematical innovation regionally as well as globally. One of the invited lectures will be a designated public presentation accessible to a broader audience on a subject of public interest, such as modeling in the social sciences. This will benefit both the scientific community and the general public in Bellingham. This award will encourage and support the involvement of traditionally underrepresented groups by providing some exclusive financial support for them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broad range of interdisciplinary research topics will be covered, including mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of large-scale complex systems in applied fields, such as biology, chemical engineering, fluid mechanics, medical science, and materials science. Topics will also include numerical linear algebra, multi-scale modeling and simulation, stochastic processes, inverse problems, and image processing. Poster sessions presented mainly by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will provide early-stage researchers with an opportunity to showcase their academic achievements. The goals of PNWNAS 2015 include: to foster the scientific interaction of computational mathematics groups from academia, industry, and government agencies working in a broad range of science and technology; to promote mathematical innovation regionally as well as globally; to facilitate interactions that potentially lead to regional employment and internship opportunities for postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates; and to attract prospective students into the Pacific Northwest's higher education programs in computational and applied mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

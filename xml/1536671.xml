    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to enhance student participation in the 2015 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium by providing student support for the meeting. The conference theme is research in additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing, known colloquially as "3D Printing", has in the last few years become a topic of interest nationally and internationally. It has become recognized as a significant advanced manufacturing technology that will create new industries and concomitant domestic jobs for an educated workforce. The 2015 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium will be held at the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin from August 10 to12, 2015. It is anticipated that 220 presentations will be made, 192 oral presentations and 28 poster presentations. Students will have full access to participation in the general organized oral presentations as well as the poster event. The strong international participation will provide domestic participants an excellent opportunity to gain valuable information on research in the field. There is ample time allotted for informal interactions of world-class researchers and students in formal meeting settings and also in informal social events during the meeting. Information on the Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium, as well as the full conference proceedings, will be made available through the worldwide web at http://sffsymposium.engr.utexas.edu/. Students will have the opportunity to present their work in a world-class setting and will network with international leading senior researchers and other students in their field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF award is to provide partial participant support for up to 80 domestic students to attend the meeting. Selection of students will be made by the chair of the conference organizing committee based on the following criteria: domestic student status, underrepresented groups, engagement in additive manufacturing, co-author or presenter on an oral presentation or poster. Each student awardee will pay a reduced registration fee, approximately $300 less than the cost of participation. If fewer than 80 domestic students attend the meeting in 2015, a one-year, no-cost extension will be requested with the intent to use the residual funds for identical student support for the 2016 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>People have different ways of learning and thinking, termed cognitive styles. Past research in website design has shown that there is a link between cognitive style and user behavior. This project takes this promising foundation and applies it to the design of physical products. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project investigates whether or not it is possible to use sensor data and morphing algorithms, a type of learning algorithm, to design a faucet that can "know" what a person wants to do, and how they prefer to do it, via an underlying relationship between cognitive style and behavior. If so, can the faucet be designed in a way that its behavior is adaptable and pleasing to distinct cognitive styles, while also reducing water consumption. Faucets and showers account for 20% of household water usage, yet have received no "smart" design improvements to curtail water use. On the contrary, research shows that current automatic on/off faucets use more water than conventional faucets. If successful, this research will advance the design of household appliances that decrease water consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objective is to create a design method that uses morphing algorithms to design generative, customized product behavior that responds to the user's cognitive style and the task they are performing. This involves: (1) Reworking existing morphing/learning algorithms to make them generate a customized product behavior, instead of serving-up predetermined design permutations; (2) Creating a protocol to identify meaningful independent variables (sensor data) that serve as the parameters for controling morphing; (3) Incorporating feedback from users, in the form of faucet manual adjustments, to the behavior updating process; and (4) Balancing exploration of the behavior space and exploitation of knowledge gained. The sensor data used in this initial research will be simulated based on a pilot study. The research advances the state of the art in learning algorithms, increasing their usefulness in design by allowing for continuous-space design exploration in response to manual human-in-the-loop user interaction behavior. If successful, it will result in a physical product that is capable of testing the relationship between cognitive style and user interaction. This product will be used in future human-subject experiments, potentially building new cognitive models of user/product interaction.</AbstractNarration>

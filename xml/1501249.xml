    <AbstractNarration>This travel grant supports the participation of US-based graduate students and other early career mathematicians in the international conference "Theory and Application of Syzygies" held in Saarbrucken, Germany on July 1-3, 2015. The central topic of the conference is the study of syzygies in mathematics, which involves matrices whose entries are polynomials. These kinds of matrices arise throughout pure and applied mathematics, and thus research about syzygies can be applied in many fields, including computational algebra and algebraic geometry. The meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for junior mathematicians to learn about major new developments in these fields and to seek new research problems to explore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference brings together leading experts on syzygies and related topics across a range of fields, and it will highlight many of the recent breakthroughs in the study of syzygies. Due to its relatively moderate size, this conference offers a unique opportunity for this array of top researchers on syzygies to come together and discuss avenues for new research. In addition, since many groundbreaking results on syzygies take place at an intersection between multiple fields, this conference offers a high potential to spur new collaborations or avenues for research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more details, see the conference web site http://www.math.uni-sb.de/ag-schreyer/conference/ .</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Travel support for trainees to attend the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) is provided. PSB is one of the leading Bioinformatics conferences, especially for students. PSB has a program of cutting-edge topics, many of which are emerging in their respective field. This leads to an exciting and innovative series of presentations. PSB also includes several interactive sessions including poster sessions, discussion sessions, and most meals together. Due to the size of this meeting (between 200-300 participants), this makes it a perfect venue for young scientists to network and really interact with the field leaders. PSB brings together the outstanding science in many subdisciplines of Biocomputing. This results in the conference being an excellent learning event for all participants. However, for the students, they are able to learn about these rich, diverse areas from the experts, ask questions, and potentially discuss the downstream projects that may result in which they can participate. Previous student attendees indicate that it is one of the best for learning a broad range of important and complementary topics in bioinformatics.</AbstractNarration>

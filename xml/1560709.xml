    <AbstractNarration>Wan, Jiandi &lt;br/&gt;CBET - 1560709 &lt;br/&gt;EAGER: An Interfacial Approach to Artificial Red Blood Cells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red blood cells (RBCs) deliver oxygen to tissues and are the essential component of blood. Significant loss of RBCs due to emergencies and/or combat injuries requires blood transfusion, a life-saving intervention. RBCs, however, can only be stored outside the body for 14 days and transfusion of stored RBCs has been linked to increased risks of sickness and death. Artificial RBCs that have the similar features with natural RBCs and an improved storage lifetime are expected to overcome the problems associated with natural RBCs. Furthermore, artificial RBCs can be utilized as drug delivery vehicles when specific drugs are incorporated, and thus provide novel therapeutic advances in drug delivery. Current methods used to generate artificial RBCs, however, fail to mimic either the shape or softness of natural RBCs or have limited oxygen delivery ability. Artificial RBCs-based drug delivery is also less studied. Here, we are planning to produce artificial RBCs using innovative nano/micro technologies that enable the recapitulation of key features of natural RBCs and development of artificial RBCs-based drug delivery system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Artificial RBCs play a critical role in blood transfusion, which is a commonly life-saving intervention, especially for emergencies and combat injuries. This is particularly true considering the risks associated with allogeneic blood transfusion such as exposure to blood borne pathogens and inaccurate cross-matching for blood types. In addition, blood storage lesion has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality in clinical trials, and thus has urged the research of alternative blood substitutes. Most developed artificial RBCs, however, have encountered shortcomings including tissue injuries, immune system suppression, and particularly the low hemoglobin encapsulation efficiency. Most importantly, all current artificial RBCs are used as oxygen carriers and do not have the ability to fulfill other key physiological functions of natural RBCs such as deformation-induced adenosine triphosphate release, which is known to be critically important in the regulation of vascular tone. Here, by using innovative microfluidic approaches and tailor-designed amphiphilic block copolymers at the molecular and nanoscale, we aim to develop artificial RBCs that mimic the morphological and mechanical properties of natural RBCs and are capable of controlled release of adenosine triphosphate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal will provide innovative engineering strategies to produce artificial RBCs mimicking the morphological, mechanical, and biological functions of natural RBCs. Such results are expected to have an important positive impact, because in addition to significant advances in blood transfusion and drug delivery, what is learned will contribute to a broader understanding of multiphase flow in microfluidics, the interfacial dynamics of nanostructure materials and their interactions with surrounding biological media. Consequently, the proposed research is expected to provide unique and otherwise unattainable conceptual, experimental and therapeutic advances in nano-bio phenomena and processes. Furthermore, once such strategies are available, there is a promise that artificial RBCs can be used as a universal type of RBCs (no need to match blood types) for safe and urgent (on-spot) blood transfusion and controlled drug delivery, which will impact significantly the nation and the global society. In addition, our research aims are coupled to our educational and outreach programs, benefiting minority and underrepresented groups, K-12 students, and graduate and undergraduate students. In particular, the experimental projects in this proposal are excellent opportunities for training young researchers in timely questions, nano/micro technologies, high-speed imaging, data analysis, presentations skills, etc. Especially as nano/micro technology is a popular theme, and the various imaging tools and experimental methods are excellent training modules.</AbstractNarration>

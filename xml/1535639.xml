    <AbstractNarration>Accelerators were invented in the 1930s to provide high-energy particles to investigate the structure of the atomic nucleus. Since their invention, there has been a growing list of applications of accelerators both for scientific discoveries and for the benefits of the society. Approximately 30,000 accelerators are currently used to diagnose and treat diseases, to improve manufacturing processes (ion implantation for electronics; hardening surfaces and materials; welding and cutting; and treating waste and medical material), and to address energy, environment and security issues (biofuel production and oil and gas exploration; cleaning flue gases of thermal power plants; and inspecting cargo and improving the monitoring of nuclear test ban compliance). If much brighter (much more intense) beams can be produced via understanding the fundamental issues that govern beam intensity, the accelerators of tomorrow promise greater opportunities. This would require breakthroughs in accelerator science and their translation into applications for the nation's health, wealth and security. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, some of the challenges in achieving much brighter beams will be tackled by the "Innovations in bright beam science" team at the University of Chicago. (i) A study will be undertaken to understand the science that underlies dramatic improvements in the quality factor of superconducting, radio-frequency cavities via nitrogen doping. This could reduce capital and operational costs. (ii) A proof-of-principle experiment for accelerators with highly non-linear components will be performed. This could lead to a significant suppression of the instabilities that have plagued intense beams. (iii) New mechanisms will be developed to produce intense X-rays, an indispensable tool for studying the atomic and molecular arrangement of materials.</AbstractNarration>

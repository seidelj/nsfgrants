    <AbstractNarration>This project will support early-career scientists to attend the annual q-BIO summer conference held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg VA from August 5-8, 2015. The conference will bring together theorists and experimentalists in an effort to advance the theoretical understanding of complex biological systems. The speaker list includes leaders in the field from the US and abroad. Junior scientist and students are encouraged to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To gain a deeper understanding of biology and make use of biological functions for societal benefits, the biology research enterprise is encouraged to adopt a more integrated approach to understand the multi-dimensional complexity and dynamics of these systems. This conference exemplifies one of the ways this can be achieved, namely to bring together theorists with experimentalists to learn from each other and to forge meaningful future collaborations. The organizers have made a noteworthy effort to encourage the participation from underrepresented groups, including women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>

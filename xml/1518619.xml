    <AbstractNarration>Common core standards across the United States have elevated educational requirements and demands of teachers. The new curriculum, particularly in science, includes the engineering design process as a core idea spanning problem definition, solution generation, and design optimization. Discovery of scientific principles via ?technology? experiments and the importance of hands-on, real world projects are stressed. Teachers are struggling to incorporate engineering design challenges into their classroom as it has been completely lacking in teacher training programs offered by colleges of education across the nation and there is a dearth of options being created to fill this gap. This proposal is partially motivated from multiple requests from school districts outside of the Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science (CEEMS) targeted partnership to provide their math and science teachers with training in challenge-based learning (CBL) and engineering design process (EDP). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cincinnati Engineering Enhanced Math and Science Program has developed and implemented a successful professional development model to train secondary teachers to integrate challenge-based learning and the engineering design process into the teaching of math and science content. The training was developed in response to new state and national standards. Key components include: 1) providing teachers multiple opportunities to experience engineering design challenges, 2) empowering teachers through ongoing coaching support, and 3) engaging students through hands-on activities and allowing choices to project selection and design. CEEMS is firmly rooted in current research in the fields of science, mathematics, and engineering education and is based on studies on how students learn mathematics and science if engineering is used as the context.</AbstractNarration>

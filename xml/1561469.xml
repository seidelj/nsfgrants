    <AbstractNarration>The Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science (LSUMNS) is one of the largest and most active research oriented natural history museums in the United States. The LSUMNS is reputed internationally for its documentation of biodiversity and its support of cutting edge research. This reputation has made LSUMNS the premier public institution in Louisiana for the deposition of specimens documenting the biodiversity of the state and region. To accomplish this the university has invested in facilities to house and secure the collections. A recent acquisition of over 40,000 amphibian, reptile and fish specimens by the museum takes advantage of this investment. This project funds the utilization of renovated space at LSUMNS, allowing for the consolidation of all vertebrate collections in the same building with modern facilities for specimen storage, preserving this biodiversity repository for posterity. The specimens to be incorporated include one of the largest collections of turtles in the world, and a large number of Gulf of Mexico fishes collected prior to the 2010 oil spill. Plans are to digitize specimens and integrate these data into online resources, making these collections available to national and international researchers. Outreach and educational opportunities will engage undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds through collaboration with existing programs at the museum. Students will be trained in modern digitization methods, curatorial methods and the use of social media for public outreach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to incorporate a recently acquired collection of fishes, reptile and amphibian specimens into the collections of the LSU Museum of Natural Science. The amphibian and reptile collection were acquired from Tulane University. LSU has provided additional space to house the collections and has committed to the support of a collections manager to help integrate these important specimens into the museum's collections. Plans are to install mobile compactor shelving, new storage tanks and racks to fully and efficiently integrate the specimens into the renovated space. The high-density storage system will also provide room for future growth of the collection. The investigator also plans on digitization of these specimens to increase their accessibility to the community. The digitized collections data will be shared with and made available online through iDigBio (www.idigbio.org). The project will collaborate with existing education and outreach programs at the LSU Museum for public outreach and in the training of undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

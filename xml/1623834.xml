    <AbstractNarration>Conventional microprocessors are designed primarily for sustained&lt;br/&gt;performance; they can operate at near-peak performance essentially&lt;br/&gt;indefinitely until their energy source is exhausted. In battery and&lt;br/&gt;cooling constrained environments such as mobile devices, sustained power&lt;br/&gt;(and, consequently, peak performance) must be limited to at most a few&lt;br/&gt;watts so that the device can dissipate heat using only passive&lt;br/&gt;convection. However, many interactive mobile applications (such as&lt;br/&gt;handwriting/speech recognition or image-based search) instead call for&lt;br/&gt;bursts of intense computation in response to user input, creating the&lt;br/&gt;need for a new ultra-responsive operating regime: rather than limit peak&lt;br/&gt;power assuming sustained operation, systems should instead exploit heat&lt;br/&gt;storage to enable brief computation bursts that greatly exceed&lt;br/&gt;sustainable thermal limits without overheating. This project&lt;br/&gt;investigates an approach called "computational sprinting", the central&lt;br/&gt;essence of which is to compute at unsustainable rates but only briefly&lt;br/&gt;so that temperatures do not reach unsafe levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to address the architectural, thermal,&lt;br/&gt;electrical, and software barriers to ultra-responsiveness via&lt;br/&gt;computational sprinting. In particular, the project explores: (1)&lt;br/&gt;architectures and memory systems that sprint via parallelism (activating&lt;br/&gt;tens of reserve functional units/cores) and voltage boosting&lt;br/&gt;(overdriving cores for single-thread performance) while facilitating&lt;br/&gt;fast burst onsets; (2) thermal designs that improve thermal response&lt;br/&gt;behavior to enable longer and more intense sprints; (3) mobile-optimized &lt;br/&gt;electrical designs that provide stable supply voltages&lt;br/&gt;despite current surges of an order-of-magnitude or more; and &lt;br/&gt;(4) software mechanisms that explicitly manage limited thermal budgets &lt;br/&gt;and anticipate and stage data needed during the sprint. The project&lt;br/&gt;includes the fabrication of an experimental testbed to approximate the&lt;br/&gt;computational, thermal and electrical capabilities of a future many-core&lt;br/&gt;mobile device and to provide practical experience with sprinting.&lt;br/&gt;Project impacts include (1) developing and advancing techniques for&lt;br/&gt;improving the responsiveness of mobile devices and (2) integrating the&lt;br/&gt;discoveries into a new cross-departmental course on computer system&lt;br/&gt;design.</AbstractNarration>

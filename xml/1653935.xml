    <AbstractNarration>The project will provide detailed understanding of the active sites and atom transfer processes involved in catalytic conversion of various bio oil molecules derived from lignocellulosic biomass. Identification of highly active metal sites on reducible oxide supports will enable design of catalysts with optimized composition and site location. The catalyst structure-function relationships thus obtained will provide design guidance for converting a broad range of oxygenated organic compounds to high-value fuels and chemicals. The research will be integrated with educational and outreach programs targeting American Indian students, while also emphasizing the importance of safety in chemical processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomass conversion processes typically create a broad range of oxygenated intermediates that are treated further by catalytic processes to remove the excess oxygen and build longer chain hydrocarbons attractive as fuel components and chemical intermediates. Efficient conversion requires multifunctional catalysts - typically composed of metal and metal oxide active sites - capable of several simultaneous or sequential reaction steps. While it is well understood that different types of active sites are required for the different reactions, the exact nature of those sites and their ideal proximity is not known. This study will examine those factors by decoupling metal sites from reducible metal oxide sites using carbon nanotube (CNT) bridges as hydrogen shuttles. By eliminating direct contact between the metal and metal oxide components, and by varying the metal-metal oxide spacing along the CNTs, the study will provide an opportunity to examine independently two important aspects of bifunctional catalysis on reducible metal oxides: metal-support interactions and hydrogen spillover from the metal to the metal oxide support. The study will also investigate how the metal-support and hydrogen spillover effects vary with different types of molecules common to biomass deconstruction processes. More broadly, the study will provide catalyst design guidance that can be used to improve the technoeconomic viability of a broad range of chemical reactions including those of importance in natural gas processing. The PI is a faculty mentor for the American Indian Science and Engineering Society at the University of Oklahoma, and plans to use the project as an opportunity to expand his on-going efforts to recruit Native American students at all levels via outreach camps that emphasize the importance of sustainable energy while generating excitement towards engineering degrees amongst American Indian and other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>In recent years, cloud storage has provided ubiquitous and easily accessible remote data repository possibilities to clients. Applications of cloud computing require security assurances but there are many shortcomings in the current cloud security. Current approaches, like encryption, digital signatures and cryptographic keys generally negatively affect the performance of clouds. This project will identify a catalog of security patterns for the cloud computing environment. Security patterns provide design solutions to recurring security problems and define a way to express requirements and solutions concisely, as well as provide a communication vocabulary for designers. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Professor Hyoungshick Kim at the Security Lab, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea. The collaboration affords a U.S. graduate student an opportunity to learn about unique cloud security strategies developed for the Korean cloud computing environment, enabling new insights to identify a set of security patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using Category Theory and an interpretive epistemology, this project will design a prototype to implement the PI?s pattern-based architectural solution to a widely used cloud Dropbox or Amazon S3. The research will provide a statistical data model to prove the statistical significance rendered by a new security pattern-oriented cloud design developed by the PI. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with National Research Foundation of Korea.</AbstractNarration>

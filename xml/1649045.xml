    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending the 2016 Privacy-Preserving Information Retrieval (PIR) Workshop. The workshop is co-located with the ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval in Pisa, Italy. The Student Fellowships helps cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible for them to attend the workshop and discuss and disseminate their work. The workshop also provides an opportunity for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIR Workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in Information Retrieval, Privacy and Security. Students benefit from not only the technical paper presentations, but also other activities such as talk from industry leaders, and panel/breakout sessions which pair information retrieval and privacy researchers together to discuss about emerging challenges across the two communities. These sessions provide students with an opportunity to learn the recent research developments in an emerging interdisciplinary field, while the informal settings of the breakouts also enable students to get critical yet encouraging feedback on their work from senior members of the community.</AbstractNarration>

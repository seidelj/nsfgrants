    <AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, the University of Arkansas, Little Rock (UALR) is working with Henderson Middle School, UALR Children's International and the Museum of Discovery to recruit 40 undergraduate students majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines and prepare them to become secondary school teachers. Additionally, internships will support five first and second-year students in informal science settings to provide them with early teaching experiences. Upon completion of licensure, Noyce teachers will be supported by biannual UALRTeach Professional Development Days during induction, and work primarily in the high-needs Little Rock School District.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arkansas is in particular need of STEM trained professionals due to the overall shortfall in college degrees within the state which contribute to severe shortages in STEM areas, and the UALRTeach program will respond to this need through the preparation of highly-qualified STEM secondary teachers. Underrepresented students will be targeted for recruitment into the UALRTeach program to increase the diversity of secondary STEM teachers.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Syngnathiformes (seahorses, pipefishes, trumpetfish and relatives) are a group of fishes with unusual and novel modes of locomotion, reproduction, and feeding. Nearly all species are characterized by an elongated snout, which they rotate towards prey during feeding strikes. Recent research has shown that seahorses and pipefish are using power amplification to achieve extremely fast rotations, resulting in strikes that are among the fastest recorded for any fish (less than 2.5 milliseconds). This research will reconstruct the sequential evolutionary assembly of this mechanically extreme feeding mechanism and will investigate the consequences of this feeding mechanism on head shape diversity. The findings of this work will advance knowledge about how complex structure-function relationships evolve and influence subsequent structural evolution. The study will produce set of phylogenetic trees that reveal the evolutionary relationships among over 200 syngnathiform species. These will be a valuable resource and shared with other researchers to advance knowledge of the evolutionary history of this unique and unusual group of fishes. Other data and products from this research, including slow-motion videos, will engage a wide audience in the diversity of fish feeding strategies by incorporation into existing coursework at the University of California, Davis and through YouTube. In addition to forming an ambitious and integrative doctoral dissertation, this research will involve undergraduates interested in pursuing STEM related fields through hands-on training and experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate the evolution of a mechanically extreme and complex feeding mechanism in syngnathiform fishes, beginning with the inference of a phylogeny using modern hybrid-enrichment (ultraconserved elements, UCEs) and next-generation sequencing technologies (Objective #1). Previous research has shown that seahorses and pipefish use power amplification to rotate their head towards prey faster than would be possible by direct muscle activation, and it has been proposed that this mechanism relies on a unique pivot joint in the skull. A combination of morphological and functional approaches including high-speed video, biomechanical modeling, and micro-CT scanning will be used to characterize and compare the feeding functional morphology of lineages related to seahorses and pipefish (Objective #2). The phylogeny from Objective #1 will be used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the structural and functional changes necessary for power-amplified feeding in syngnathiform fishes and to test hypotheses about how the possession of this specialized mechanism has influenced the evolution of head shape in syngnathiforms (Objective #3). Models of continuous character evolution will to be fit to craniofacial shape data and compared in the software program OUwie to test the hypothesis that the possession of power amplification exerts strong stabilizing selection on craniofacial morphology. While the literature focuses on innovations that increase diversity, this work incorporates a model-testing approach to determine whether this novel feeding mechanism may constrain morphological diversification at macroevolutionary timescales.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference ''Fifty Years of the Hales-Jewett Theorem,'' held at Western Washington University, May 6-8, 2016. The conference provides a forum for mathematicians working on problems related to the Hales-Jewett theorem, a cornerstone result in combinatorics. The conference features ten plenary talks by distinguished mathematicians and provides an opportunity for students and junior researchers to meet and learn from leaders in the field. The meeting provides a venue for exchange of ideas to catalyze new developments in the field, as well as the training of graduate students working in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Hales-Jewett Theorem is a central theorem in the area of research known as Ramsey Theory. This area has been actively investigated by leading mathematicians for more than one hundred years, with recent spectacular progress. In a large collaborative effort through the Polymath Project, one of the long sought-after goals in the area, the density Hales-Jewett Theorem, was finally proved in 2012. The conference features current research on this topic and others in Ramsey Theory and related areas. Leading researchers will present new results, and during the conference there will be ample time for open discussions on the field's many unsolved problems.

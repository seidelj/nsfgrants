    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the West Coast Number Theory Conference (WCNT) for three years, from 2016 through its 50th anniversary. Since its founding by Emma and Dick Lehmer at University of California, Berkeley, WCNT has been held each December on or near the West Coast of the United States. Nearly 50 years later, WCNT continues to be a welcoming venue for young researchers and established mathematicians alike to share their work in an egalitarian environment. Number theory is an ancient discipline that is still flourishing as an active and important branch of modern mathematics. Current applications of number theory include high-speed computation and data encryption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At WCNT each talk receives equal time and every participant receives equal access to funding. The daily talks span many different areas within number theory, fostering cross-pollination of ideas and collaboration across standard borders. The conference includes formal problem sessions as well as informal evening group work sessions. With permission of the presenter, open problems from these sessions are collected and published on the conference website. Graduate students, postdocs, junior researchers, women, and minorities are especially encouraged to apply for funding. The conference website can be found at http://westcoastnumbertheory.org.</AbstractNarration>

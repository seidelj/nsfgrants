    <AbstractNarration>An International High-Performance Computing (HPC) Summer School will be held at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada on June 21-26, 2015. The goals of HPC Summer School are to: a) expand the knowledge of the attendees about high performance computing (HPC) and its applications in multiple fields of science and engineering; b) encourage the participants to continue to pursue advanced studies and professional careers that contribute to advancing scientific discovery; and c) foster new collegial friendships, partnerships, and collaborations (nationally and internationally) among the presenters and attendees. This Summer School will provide a unique opportunity for about 80 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States to learn from and to engage with leading computational scientists from numerous disciplines. The participants will talk with scientists from multiple disciplines about the challenges and opportunities their have pursued utilizing HPC to advance their research. The participants will be engaged in hands-on activities to become familiar with HPC tools they may use to improve their own research practices. The students will participate in five days of large and small group discussions to address the challenges in advancing HPC research. The participants will be assigned mentors from among the presenters and HPC professionals, and they will be provided with numerous opportunities for informal discussions with mentors. The Summer School is designed to offer a unique experience for preparing the attendees to be effective, contributing members of international research and development teams.</AbstractNarration>

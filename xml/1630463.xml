<AbstractNarration>The Artic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS) will administer and implement, "Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating (PolarTREC)", an international program that brings together U.S. teachers to participate in cutting-edge field research with polar scientists in various, and often remote, locations in the Arctic and Antarctica. Through hands-on field experiences in the Arctic and Antarctica, participating teachers (pre-service and in-service) will improve teaching strategies, develop resources for their careers, and change how they teach STEM in the classroom. The program goal is to invigorate polar science education and understanding by bringing educators and polar researchers together in professional collaboration. By integrating research and education, PolarTREC will help sustain and grow the considerable scientific and public enthusiasm for polar research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ARCUS will support a total of twelve teachers for Arctic field seasons in 2017 and Antarctic field seasons in 2017/2018. ARCUS will recruit, select, and match teachers and researchers, maintain a website for dissemination of information about the expeditions, provide orientation training for the teachers that includes field safety and communication training, provide travel support for the teachers to meet with scientists prior to deployments and for them to join the scientific expeditions in the field, and evaluate results of the program. Dissemination efforts via the website and public presentations are expected to reach many additional teachers, students, scientists and the public.</AbstractNarration>

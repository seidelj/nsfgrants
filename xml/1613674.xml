    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the history of galaxy and cluster formation fundamentally affects our knowledge&lt;br/&gt;of the Universe as a whole, and sets the context for our place within the Universe. &lt;br/&gt;This project will use Blue Waters to model the formation and evolution &lt;br/&gt;of a population of galaxies in a Coma-sized galaxy cluster, including their contribution &lt;br/&gt;to and interaction with the Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM). Modeling galaxies and the ICM in galaxy &lt;br/&gt;clusters is a formidable challenge. The morphology of the galaxies, and the energy and &lt;br/&gt;metal content of the gas is ultimately controlled by star formation processes that happen &lt;br/&gt;on molecular cloud scales of less than a million solar masses. On the other hand, &lt;br/&gt;total cluster masses exceed 10^15 solar masses; hence a dynamic range in mass of over a billion is &lt;br/&gt;necessary for consistently modeling galaxies within this context. The investigation of such &lt;br/&gt;issues is appealing to many interested in science and even in society at large. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;the results of the project will be used in a program that will introduce the use of computer &lt;br/&gt;simulations in astrophysics to science pre-majors, in the hope of ultimately attracting &lt;br/&gt;underrepresented students into a STEM major.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several advancements have now enabled the modeling of these systems. First is the availability&lt;br/&gt;of supercomputers like Blue Waters that can sustained petaflop calculations on real world&lt;br/&gt;problems. Second is the improvement of hydrodynamic modeling in Lagrangian codes. These improvements&lt;br/&gt;include better modeling of multiphase medium and the resulting instabilities, more accurate&lt;br/&gt;handling of high Mach number shocks, and better modeling of the subgrid physics including&lt;br/&gt;growth and feedback from supermassive black holes. Finally these algorithm improvements have&lt;br/&gt;been implemented in codes that can scale to a large fraction of Blue Waters even with very&lt;br/&gt;clustered datasets. This project will use the highly scalable N-body/hydrodynamics code, ChaNGa, to model the&lt;br/&gt;formation and evolution of a population of galaxies in a Coma-sized galaxy cluster, including&lt;br/&gt;their contribution to and interaction with the ICM. This model will be compared to observations&lt;br/&gt;of cluster galaxies to understand the physical and temporal origin of their morphologies.&lt;br/&gt;The model ICM will be compared to X-ray and microwave (via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) to&lt;br/&gt;understand the relation between these observables and the underlying gas properties. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;the overall mass distribution will be used to better understand how these clusters gravitationally&lt;br/&gt;lens background galaxies.</AbstractNarration>

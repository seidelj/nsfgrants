    <AbstractNarration>PI: Luo, Li-Shi &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: CBET 1643366 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal to partially fund travel expenses of students, junior researchers, and junior faculty from US institutions to attend the International Conference for Mesoscopic Methods in Engineering and Science (ICMMES) that will be held July 18-22, 2015 in Hamburg Germany. The major objective is to increase the participation of US scientists in ICMMES and to ensure a leadership position of the US in this research field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in the area of mesoscopic fluid dynamics. The creation of the ICMMES International Conference series is a direct result of the increasing importance of computation to research in all disciplines in science, engineering, and social sciences; it is also a direct response to the growing interest in multi-scale and multi-physics phenomena observed in nano- or micro-systems and biological systems. The focus of ICMMES is mesoscopic/kinetic and particle methods (e.g., lattice Boltzmann equation, lattice gas cellular automata, discrete velocity models, gas-kinetic schemes, dissipative particle dynamics, smoothed particle hydrodynamics, etc.) for computational mechanics in its broadest sense. Mesoscopic methods possess a great potential as effective means to study a wide variety of multi-scale and multi-physics systems such as complex fluids and soft matter, macro/micro, nonequilibrium, and reactive fluid/solid systems. The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs. Special consideration will be given to under-represented minorities, women, persons with disabilities, and those in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI).</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>There are ongoing efforts to develop sensors to monitor for wound infections. The vast majority of smart-bandage research and development is focused on infection sensors based on general characteristics, such as pH, temperature, and gases. While simpler to implement, these general characteristics also fluctuate significantly and can change due to a large number of factors, resulting in unreliable identification. The current standard to monitor for wound infections relies on an initial human assessment, either patient or caregiver, of when an infection is developing. The decision is based on visual inspection, smell of the wound, and other patient symptoms, such as fever. When an infection is suspected, samples are collected from the wound and sent to a central facility for analysis. At the centralized facility, plate culturing is the gold standard for pathogen identification. The technique is simple, but requires 24 hours or more for identification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to create, test, and disseminate electrochemical sensor technology for quantitative microbiological studies. Specifically, this approach will utilize micro-fabricated electrochemical sensors to rapidly and selectively detect molecules produced by bacteria. The detected molecules are uniquely produced by only certain species of cells; therefore, by detecting the molecules it is possible to determine which cells and how many of them are present in a sample. The proposed technology will allow caregivers to remotely monitor their patients and provide them with better care. In a hospital post-op or burn ward, rapid identification is the primary customer need, as wounds are monitored routinely, but require time-consuming tests when an infection is suspected to identify the pathogen. In the home, patients must determine on their own if they have an infection developing or wait until a home healthcare worker visits them. The proposed product could reduce the visit frequency for home healthcare professionals if the wounds are monitored remotely, decreasing the workload for an already overburdened and understaffed system.</AbstractNarration>

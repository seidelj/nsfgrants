    <AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the International Symposium on Cluster and Nanomaterials in Richmond Virginia, on October 26-29, 2015. This symposium brings together a variety of researchers from academia, national laboratories, and industry, belonging to diverse disciplines: physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, engineering, and medicine. The focus of the symposium is on the important role that clusters and nanostructures play within the energy and life sciences. In particular, central topics to be covered include the efficient storage and conversion of alternative energy sources such as solar power and hydrogen; bioactive, bioresponsive, and biomimetic materials; nanotoxicity; bioengineering and regenerative medicine. Topics related to both areas such as reactions, catalysis, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties will also be featured. NSF support will enable the participation of 30 contributors, who might not otherwise be able to attend. Half of the requested funds are destined for the support of young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the International Symposium on Cluster and Nanomaterials in Richmond Virginia, on October 26-29, 2015.

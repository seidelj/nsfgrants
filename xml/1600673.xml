    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) funds conferences as a means of discussing and disseminating best practices in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education at HBCUs. The goal of the conference at Virginia State University is to review successful programs at selected HBCUs that help retain students from groups underrepresented in STEM majors with a focus on mathematics preparation. The conference allows for the sharing of information about student skill development programs and to discuss replication by other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The programs to be reviewed at the conferences include: the K-12 Algebra Project pedagogy for college-level mathematics courses; Project Knowledge which focuses on building academic skills and motivation during the critical first three semesters of college; partnerships of HBCUs with local school districts; and interventions using cognitive skills training that improve the mathematics performance of African American college students. Specific aims are to: disseminate information on effective interventions for improving mathematics performance in African American STEM majors; provide opportunities for participants to share best practices that are having an impact at HBCUs; and provide networking opportunities for future faculty training in these interventions so that they can be applied at other institutions. The project is informed by an on-going evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

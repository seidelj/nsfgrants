    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will fund a three day workshop focused on the most recent Antarctic research, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary Earth Sciences. The workshop will be held September 20-22, 2015, which will be ideal timing for Antarctic researchers to attend. In addition, it will immediately follow the regular workshop for West Antarctic Ice Sheet researchers, held in the same venue, thus allowing interdisciplinary interactions, and potentially minimizing travel costs for participants. The timing might coincide with the release of the upcoming NRC report on future Antarctic research priorities. The single-session meeting will be guided by a seven-member interdisciplinary organizing committee that will identify unifying session themes based on their knowledge of recent research, and community interest. The scientific program will include invited presentations by established and early career scientists, contributed presentations, daily poster sessions and dedicated discussion time to promote exchange of ideas. One longer term goal is to establish a regular forum for U.S. Antarctic scientists to disseminate research results and engage in interdisciplinary discussions. In advance of the anticipated Shackleton Glacier logistics hub, the meeting would include a dedicated session to discuss logistics in the overall context of NSF Polar Programs, and will inform the community on the latest information from NSF and Antarctic Support Contract staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will include a focus on basic Antarctic Earth Science research, along with critical questions about Antarctica?s role in the global environment that impact human welfare. The long term history of the Antarctic ice sheets is crucial to understanding the controls on sea level and global biogeochemical cycles. To facilitate more effective translation of research findings, the meeting will also include a session on effective science communication to help all researchers improve their engagement with the public.</AbstractNarration>

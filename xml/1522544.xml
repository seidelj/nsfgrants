    <AbstractNarration>The Tropical Cyclone Research Forum will be held on March 3-7, 2015 at the Marriott Hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. The theme of the workshop is "Tropical Cyclone Operations &amp; Research: Setting the Future Course". Topics include: snapshots of tropical cyclone R&amp;D; federal numerical modeling initiatives; transitioning research to operations; tropical cyclone model development and technology transfer; observations and observing strategies satellite, aircraft reconnaissance, unmanned aircraft systems, upper-ocean observations/profiles; improvements in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services; and social science applications to the tropical cyclone forecast and warning notification problem. The Tropical Cyclone Research Forum is sponsored by NSF/Physical and Dynamic Meteorology Program, NOAA/Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and the Office of Naval Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;At the Tropical Cyclone Research Forum, representatives from the academic research community, industry and Federal agencies will have the opportunity to discuss the latest research on Tropical Cyclone activity and forecasting such as:&lt;br/&gt;1. Review of the 2014 hurricane/typhoon season from both an operations and reconnaissance perspective.&lt;br/&gt;2. The Research Priorities of the Operational Centers&lt;br/&gt;3. Observations and Observing Strategies&lt;br/&gt;4. Tropical Cyclone Model Development and Technology Transfer&lt;br/&gt;5. Transitioning Research to Operations&lt;br/&gt;6. Advances in Tropical Cyclone Forecast and Warning Products and Services&lt;br/&gt;7. Applications of Social Science Research Results/Demonstration Projects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The workshop is important to society because it brings together the academic research community, industry, Federal agencies and other user communities such as emergency management, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the United States hurricane forecasting and warning program.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports the participation of undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and other researchers in a conference on "Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics" (FACM) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) on June 5-6, 2015. FACM 2015 is focused on mathematical fluid dynamics and applications in biomedicine and climate science. There will be dedicated minisymposia on biofluid dynamics, the connection between mathematical modeling and experiment, geophysical fluid dynamics, wave propagation in fluids, and computational methods, including high-performance computing and multiscale methods. In addition, there will be five minisymposia on the application of statistics and data analysis to biomedicine and to atmosphere/ocean science, which are areas of great current interest. This conference series brings together mathematicians, statisticians, scientists and engineers in an environment where significant interaction and cross-fertilization takes place. More information can be found on the conference website http://m.njit.edu/Events/FACM15/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FACM conference series has been organized over the past eleven years by the Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics and Statistics at NJIT. The annual meeting is a forum for the dissemination of research in applied and computational mathematics and statistics. FACM conferences are more intimate and student centered than large society meetings, and a goal of the organizers is to introduce future leaders of applied mathematics to established investigators and emerging research areas. Participation among graduate students and postdocs is greatly enhanced with contributed talks through which they give presentations in minisymposia alongside leading scientists. For students and postdocs, this will be a learning and networking experience that will help them with their research and career paths. Special efforts will be made to continue the participation underrepresented groups in the conference.</AbstractNarration>

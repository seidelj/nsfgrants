    <AbstractNarration>ECCS-1542224&lt;br/&gt;Third Arab-American Frontiers of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Symposium:&lt;br/&gt;A unique opportunity to engage the next generation of S&amp;T leaders &lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary scientific collaboration plays an important role in addressing global challenges that impact every region across the world. These challenges often require national, as well as cross-boundary approaches. The Arab-American Frontiers Symposium is a unique type of gathering that convenes outstanding young scientists, engineers, and medical professionals from the United States and the Arab region to discuss exciting advances and opportunities in their fields. The third symposium will be held on December 5-7, 2015 in partnership with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia and the National Academies under the overarching theme of "Sensing Technologies, Networks and Applications". The program is participant-driven and is therefore an excellent opportunity for the symposium's attendees to strengthen their leadership, communication and organizational skills and expand their professional network. In addition, by convening a group of participants which is diverse not only in research fields, but also geographically, the Arab American Frontiers symposia will build bridges between countries and promote science diplomacy. Thus, the Arab-American Frontiers program can forge partnerships at an early career stage to improve scientific, engineering and medical research in the United States and the Arab region and build successful long-term collaborative activities among future S&amp;T leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Summary:&lt;br/&gt;The Arab-American Frontiers of Science, Engineering, and Medicine program brings together outstanding young scientists, engineers, and medical professionals from the United States and the 21 countries of the Arab League for a symposium to discuss cutting-edge scientific and technological advances in their fields. The third symposium will be hosted by the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) on its campus in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. The symposium has three objectives: (1) Enhance scientific dialogue and exchange among young researchers in Arab countries and the United States; (2) Encourage and strengthen scientific collaboration and the transfer of techniques and approaches across disciplines within and beyond the region; and (3) Empower young researchers to assume leadership roles. During the symposium, U.S. and Arab scientists, engineers and medical professionals will discuss major scientific advances on a wide array of topics under the overarching theme of "Sensing Technologies, Networks and Applications". The symposium will cover advances in discovery of new materials, design of new sensor platforms and networks, and ingenious management, assimilation and interpretation of data and our ever increasing need to understand our changing world from molecular to planetary scales. The experience is intellectually stimulating and generates a dialogue across disciplines considered as key for scientific innovation. These exchanges on cutting-edge scientific knowledge among U.S. and Arab participants take place through: five plenary sessions covering a wide range of disciplines; poster presentations by each participant; educational exhibits, and informal discussions. Following the symposium, Arab American Frontiers fellowships (travel seed grants) are awarded to pairs of participants who intend to collaborate on a research topic of common interest.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This award supports research on fabrication of micro-scale ceramic structures by combining green-state micro-machining and powder-injection molding processes. The research objective is to gain fundamental knowledge on the combined process through integrated experimental and modeling studies. The specific research approach will include (1) analyzing the green micromachining process for different ceramic materials, powder and binder characteristics, and process parameters to determine their effect on process characteristics, including geometric quality and productivity, and (2) characterizing and modeling mechanical and geometric characteristics of parts fabricated using the combined process. The research will include aluminum-nitride and silicon-carbide as sample systems, and will demonstrate the effectiveness of findings by fabricating industrial ceramic parts. The educational objectives include enhancing the future manufacturing workforce, and improving existing manufacturing curricula, and attracting students to manufacturing through pre-college outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to rapid, predictable, reproducible, low cost, and accurate manufacture of ceramic parts with micro-scale features. Ceramics offer many advantages such as high-temperature strength, chemical stability, thermal conductivity, and electrical insulation. Although the prevailing micro-fabrication technologies have been effective in creating micro-electronics components and sensors from semiconductor materials, we currently do not an effective micro-manufacturing technique to create three-dimensional micro-structures from ceramics. This approach will provide and effective way to make ceramic components with micro-structures, thereby facilitating exciting technological and scientific advances. Micro-scale ceramic devices and parts will benefit many industries, including medical devices, electronics/lighting systems, and clean energy technologies. The knowledge gained from this work will provide in-depth understanding of green micromachining and powder-injection molding processes to facilitate fabricating parts in a predictable fashion. Collaboration with industry and national laboratories will enable rapid transfer of research findings and our technology to industry, thereby impacting the advanced manufacturing industry. This research is also critical for the United States in its efforts to gain back the manufacturing leadership through advanced manufacturing efforts.</AbstractNarration>

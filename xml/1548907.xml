    <AbstractNarration>Understanding the outcomes associated with R&amp;D funding requires accurate linking of funding with the papers produced by the funded work. This proposal develops a methodology to accurately link grants with topics, an important challenge for the development of a rigorous, quantitative understanding and analysis of science policy. The research will provide methods to accurately and consistently identify coherent research areas and systematically link those topic areas to research funding and research output, such as scientific publications, using text and other features. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to accurately link grants and topics in a consistent way would be an important advance in the usefulness of STAR METRICS data. In addition to developing a methodology, this project also establishes the accuracy of existing NIH grant-to-article linkage data, and develop grant-to-article linkage data for non-NIH grants -- data which are not readily available. More accurate grant-article and grant-topic linkages will facilitate other research and be important to the STAR METRICS platform.</AbstractNarration>

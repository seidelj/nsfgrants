    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to broaden and diversifying the participation of students at The International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2017) and its PhD Forum. IPDPS is a premier international conference for presenting the research results, problem solutions, and insights on new challenges in parallel and distributed computing. It is the flagship conference of the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Committee on Parallel Processing. Its PhD Forum is a well established program that has evolved over the past ten years. Its innovative model provides a comprehensive experience for students, including research, career development, and networking. The forum is structured as a series of panels for career advice, relaxed mentoring sessions over lunch, speed networking, and a formal research poster session. Through the multiple sessions students are instructed on best practices for research and presentation, while getting a first hand experience on authoring, structuring, and presenting a research poster. At the same time, students are provided with valuable advice and perspectives from leaders on the field regarding career choices. As stated by NSF's mission, this project indirectly promotes the progress of science and contributes toward a more productive workforce development by investing in the future generation of researchers in the parallel and distributed processing field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, the IPDPS student program provides effective opportunities for training and mentoring, student networking, and integration of students into the research community. Since the goal of this project is to promote a broader and more diverse participation of students, a targeted and conscious effort will be made to reach out to students that typically would not be able to attend the conference without financial support, including undergraduate students, graduate students in their first year, students attending their first conference, and students that belong to underrepresented groups in STEM fields, particularly women.</AbstractNarration>

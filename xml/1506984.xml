    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry, and co-funding from the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET), Professor Lisa Holland of West Virginia University is developing new materials for protein separations to elucidate the subtle changes in biomolecules for applications ranging from screening enzyme inhibition to identifying post-translational protein modifications. To meet this challenge, self-tuning phospholipid nanophases are adapted to sort, screen, or identify specific properties of biomolecules. The broader impacts are addressed through the support of the professional development of chemistry graduate students who participate in innovative and interdisciplinary research experiences earning PhD degrees and ultimately entering the workforce with the ability to work across scientific disciplines. The award also supports an outreach activity to personalize chemistry experiences and to increase public science literacy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focusses on thermally reversible phospholipid nanophases that have high utility as a chemical sieving agent and as a viscosity additive to exploit shape-based differences in frictional drag. Various additives to tune protein selectivity are examined. The project establishes the conditions and fundamental properties of the nanophases for protein sieving and multifunctional separations. An outreach program developed by Professor Holland at area schools enables teachers to incorporate low-cost microscale experiments into introductory chemistry education. The products are made accessible to other teachers by documenting inexpensive device design, engaging educational suppliers, developing the curriculum, and reporting the educational assessment.</AbstractNarration>

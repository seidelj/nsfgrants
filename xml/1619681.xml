    <AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. These strategies facilitate the production of well-prepared students highly-qualified and motivated to pursue graduate education or careers in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the United States (U.S.) to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. The Michigan Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (MI-LSAMP) was established in 2005 in response to the need for a more diverse and skilled technical workforce. That need still exists and is particularly acute in the State of Michigan. The MI-LSAMP currently consists of four, 4-year institutions (University of Michigan, lead institution; Michigan State University; Wayne State University; Western Michigan University) and two community colleges (Mott Community College and Washtenaw Community College). The goals of MI-LSAMP are to significantly increase the:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Retention and graduation of underrepresented students in STEM bachelor's degree programs via comprehensive support programs and mentored research; &lt;br/&gt;2) Number of students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups transferring to STEM bachelor's degree programs; and &lt;br/&gt;3) Number of students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups pursuing graduate degrees in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These goals support NSF's strategic goal to "cultivate a world-class, broadly inclusive science and engineering workforce, and expand the scientific literacy of all citizens." The goals will be accomplished through activities such as pre-first year summer programs, faculty mentored research, student-to-student mentoring, and a comprehensive 2-year STEM-emphasis transfer program that will include a specialized curriculum and the establishment of a complete wrap-around academic and social support at the community college partner institutions. In addition, the community college students would be afforded the opportunity to participate in a summer bridge program between high school and their first year in community college and then again the summer between community college and transfer to a 4-year institution. The increased engagement with community colleges, greater involvement of faculty mentors from diverse STEM disciplines, and heightened institutional commitment to underrepresented students' well-being and success will produce higher rates of retention and graduation; and moreover, lead to a more talented and diverse STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge generating research study is focused investigating the community college pathways to STEM Baccalaureate degrees for students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups in STEM. The overall supposition is that providing to underrepresented students clear and unobstructed pathways through the college-level STEM curriculum of community colleges into STEM programs at four-year institutions would result in increased STEM baccalaureate degree production.</AbstractNarration>

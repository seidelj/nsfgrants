<AbstractNarration>Intelligent autonomous vehicles have tremendous potential impacts on aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing industries for improving operational performance, maintainability, and availability, as well as for assuring system safety and security and reducing operational cost.  This new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, Undergraduate Research in Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles, at Wright State University (WSU) will operate as a gateway to attract more talented young minds to the emerging areas of intelligent autonomous vehicles and to develop technical and research skills they will need to be successful in their future graduate studies and careers in STEM. The program will target undergraduates from underrepresented groups and colleges with very limited research opportunities.  The program will focus on advancing knowledge in five crucial areas: vehicle health management, adaptation and learning methods, advanced navigation and sensor fusion, cyber security for connected vehicles, and human-vehicle interaction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wright State University will host 10 undergraduate students over an 11-week summer program where they will be exposed to the cutting edge research of intelligent autonomous vehicles and engaged in the development of innovative solutions.  The goal of the REU program is to foster the technical, professional, and personal development of the participating undergraduates, helping them to realize their full potential in STEM. Additional distinctive features of the program include: 1) a unique three-tier mentorship program involving faculty members, advisors from industry and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), and graduate students; 2) strong engagement of students from underrepresented groups; 3) a professional skills development program that will help undergraduates acquire effective research and communications skills; and 4) a combination of basic research and applied research.</AbstractNarration>

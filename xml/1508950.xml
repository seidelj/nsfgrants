    <AbstractNarration>1508950&lt;br/&gt;Palecek, Sean P. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant roadblock impeding realization of the promise of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is the inability to efficiently biomanufacture normal cells from hPSCs, in a large part resulting from an incomplete understanding of how hPSCs decide how to differentiate to more specialized cell types. These cell fate decisions are influenced by chemical and mechanical signals present in the cell environment. This project will investigate how cell remodeling of their extracellular matrix (ECM) environment affects differentiation to various testbed lineages including heart cells, blood vessel cells, brain cells, and skin cells. This deeper understanding of mechanisms of stem cell differentiation will then inform design of more efficient, defined protocols for guiding stem cells to cells in desired lineages. Thus, the project outcomes will have direct implications on producing stem cell-derived cells and tissues at lab scale or in biomanufacturing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the hypothesis that extracellular matrix remodeling by hPSCs during differentiation is a key regulator of stem cell differentiation fate. The project will identify novel autocrine/paracrine mechanisms of regulation of hPSC fate via ECM remodeling, and demonstrate the importance of designing materials and scaffolds that enhance or inhibit ECM remodeling during hPSC differentiation. To test this hypothesis, proteomic analysis will be used to identify ECM components produced during hPSC directed differentiation to cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, neurons, and keratinocytes. These experiments will identify candidate cell-synthesized ECM proteins that regulate specific hPSC differentiation fates. To test the prediction that ECM synthesis is necessary for efficient directed differentiation, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ECM gene knockout experiments will be employed to assess how inhibiting matrix production affects hPSC differentiation to cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, neurons, and keratinocytes. Finally, to test the hypothesis that matrix remodeling via proteolytic degradation of ECM affects hPSC differentiation efficiency, matrix metalloprotease expression and activity will be monitored during directed differentiation, then chemical inhibitors and genetic knockouts will be used to quantify the contributions of these proteases during directed differentiation. Education and outreach activities described in this proposal will also train stem cell engineers at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and will provide outreach to K-12 students, K-12 teachers, undergraduate students, and the general public on technical, ethical, and political aspects of stem cell science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET is co-funded by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

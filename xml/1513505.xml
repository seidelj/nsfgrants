    <AbstractNarration>The project aims to develop a novel data-centric architecture and accompanying protocols/algorithms to enable peer based data discovery, dissemination and processing for future mobile sensing applications among heterogeneous edge devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) without relying on any centralized backend as is currently done. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses named data to enable direct data sharing and processing among vast numbers of heterogeneous edge devices. The research systematically investigates: 1) Naming structures and constructs suitable for precise reference and characterization of various kinds of data; 2) Data discovery and name matching mechanisms for devices to find what data are available and acquire desired ones; 3) Transparent processing that derives and extracts new data from raw sensing samples. The project combines architecture, protocol and algorithm design, optimization, testbed implementations and software simulations for a full-scale study on the above issues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will enable a future generation of mobile sensing applications no longer requiring a centralized backend, thus completely eliminating the associated monetary, manpower costs, and dependence on the availability and performance of Internet connectivity. The PIs are developing a new graduate course, training graduate students, and reaching out to undergraduate and high school students to build futuristic applications. Joint explorations with leading research and development organizations are conducted to apply the research results. The publications, software and experimental data are shared with the community to foster further research on this architecture.</AbstractNarration>

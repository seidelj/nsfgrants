    <AbstractNarration>The proposed research seeks to improve our understanding of the lower layers of the atmosphere associated with tropical cyclones (hurricanes and tropical storms). This study will use also investigate the band of thunderstorms, near the equator, termed the "Intertropical Convergence Zone (or "ITCZ"). This band of storms can often be the source region for developing tropical storms and hurricanes. The results of this study will improve our understanding of the complexities of the lower atmosphere associated with these destructive storms, as well as potentially improve our ability to better forecast the track and intensity of these storms. This research will train a graduate student at the investigator's home institution and new knowledge will be shared with other investigators through peer-reviewed publications and presentations. This new knowledge will also be incorporated into courses taught in the investigator's department, training a new generation of students in tropical meteorology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to further our understanding of the dynamics of tropical cyclones (TCs) and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) through the use of theory and simplified analytical models. Fundamental questions of tropical atmospheric dynamics to be addressed are: (1) the development and evolution of key structural components of TCs, (2) the feedback between boundary layer shocks, Ekman pumping, and TC structure/intensity change, and (3) the processes by which concentrated Ekman pumping develops in the ITCZ boundary layer. This investigation will extend simplified models to higher dimensions/levels of complexity, and by developing numerical methods to find solutions to these models.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The Midwest Regional Robert Noyce Connections convening will strengthen connections among funded Noyce projects in the Midwest region through expanding impact from the local areas influenced by the individual projects to a larger region throughout the Midwest. The Midwest region includes more than 62 active Noyce projects across 15 states (Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin). Specific goals of the project include: (1) increasing the personal and professional connections among Midwest Noyce project members and Noyce Scholars across the region and (2) enhancing the scholarship of teaching and learning among Noyce projects and scholars. Project goals will be accomplished through facilitating an annual regional Noyce conference in 2017, 2018, and 2019 in addition to a suite of year-round networking activities for Robert Noyce project personnel and participants in the Midwestern region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three conferences will bring together Noyce investigators, pre-service and in-service Noyce Scholars, school district personnel, and project evaluation and assessment experts to share lessons learned and use lessons learned to impact the larger Noyce community. Each annual conference will draw approximately 200 participants from the Midwest region. Year-round activities will support the building of strong communities of practice by providing additional opportunities for Noyce personnel and Noyce Scholars to learn and communicate with one another through social networking and other connecting activities. This project will provide a continuing opportunity for the STEM education community to develop high quality evidence-based communities of practice in areas of high need via the annual Midwest Regional Noyce Connections in 2017, 2018, and 2019.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This proposal will inaugurate a CyberCorpsÂ®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico (PUPR), the second largest Hispanic Higher Education Institution in the USA, serving around 5,000 students in the areas of Engineering, Computer Science, Architecture, and Business Administration. Since its inception, the Institution has graduated approximately 6,000 Hispanic engineers and surveyors. The main goals of the proposed project are: 1) Successfully implement an SFS graduate program to increase research and improve education in technology areas relevant to cybersecurity; 2) Engage students in professional activities such as internships, workshops, outreach, and other SFS-sponsored activities. 3) Increase the number of qualified students entering the fields of information assurance and cyber security to protect and defend the cyberspace. Students will be selected from private and public universities from Puerto Rico and the selected scholars will participate in meaningful summer internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project intends to provide life-changing cybersecurity education to the selected students and to help them lunch life-long cybersecurity professional careers. The project will continue previous efforts to substantially increase the number of women and minorities prepared for graduate studies and careers in Cybersecurity; and will help to alleviate the nationwide shortage of qualified professionals in these areas. Students will be involved in research projects, teamwork and professional development. Research results and thesis of SFS scholars will be disseminated in Cybersecurity journals and conferences, and will also be available through the PUPR web page.</AbstractNarration>

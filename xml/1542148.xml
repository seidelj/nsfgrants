    <AbstractNarration>The San Diego Nanotechnology Infrastructure (SDNI) site of the NNCI at the University of California at San Diego offers access to a broad spectrum of nanofabrication and characterization instrumentation and expertise that enable and accelerate cutting edge scientific research, proof-of-concept demonstration, device and system prototyping, product development, and technology translation. Nanotechnology is the cornerstone of many industry sectors and a rich source for scientific discoveries and innovations. Using nanotechnologies, scientists are likely to find solutions for the most important challenges in health, communications, energy, and environment. Nanotechnology is multidisciplinary by nature and requires highly sophisticated tools and deep expertise, often unavailable or unaffordable by individual research labs and businesses. The SDNI site will offer state-of-the-art knowhow, tools, and services of nanotechnologies to all interested users across the nation in a user friendly, timely, and cost effective manner. The site will also become a nanotechnology provider to create and develop new nanotechnologies and bring them to its users. The goals of the site are to serve a large number of academic, industrial, and government users, to transfer enabling nanotechnologies from research laboratories to the general user community, to educate and train future generations of scientists and engineers in nanotechnology, and to bring nanoscaled research experience to college students and K-12 students, especially underrepresented minority students, to prepare them for STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SDNI site will build upon the existing Nano3 user facility and leverage additional specialized resources and expertise at the University of California at San Diego. The SDNI site is committed to broadening and further diversifying its already substantial user base. The proposed strategic goals include: (i) providing infrastructure that enables transformative research and education through open, affordable access to the nanofabrication and nanocharacterization tools and an expert staff capable of working with users to adapt and develop new capabilities, with emphasis in the areas of NanoBioMedicine, NanoPhotonics, and NanoMagnetism; (ii) accelerating the translation of discoveries and new nanotechnologies to the marketplace; and (iii) coordinating with other NNCI sites to provide uninterrupted service and creative solutions to meet evolving user needs. Significant growth is anticipated in the number and variety of local and regional users in the academic, government, and industrial sectors. Discoveries made by users of the SDNI site have the potential to create transformative change in fields as diverse as medicine, information technology, transportation, homeland security, and environmental science, leading to improved healthcare, faster communications, safer transit, and cleaner water and air. To develop a more diverse and productive scientific workforce, the SDNI site will expand undergraduate and graduate training programs including REU opportunities to train 900 students over five years. Through an RET program and other activities, the site will work to increase the number of students from underrepresented minority groups who pursue studies and, ultimately, careers in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

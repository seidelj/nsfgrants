    <AbstractNarration>The conference award will support the next meeting of the interdisciplinary "Working Group on Testing Theoretical Models of Individual Behavior in Dynamic Social Dilemmas" (SD Working Group). Social dilemmas are situations where what is best for the individual and what is best for the group are in conflict. Results from research are directly applicable for public policy and real-world issues, such as charitable giving, the environment, international conflict, and local governance of public goods and common pool resources, among others. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of the SD Working Group promotes the cross-fertilization of ideas and the progression of the science of social dilemmas research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since its inception, the SD Working Group has highlighted the importance of combining multiple methods (including formal theory; laboratory, field and survey experiments; agent-based modeling; and observational data) with insights from multiple disciplinary perspectives. This multi-method, interdisciplinary collaboration leads to improved understanding and modeling of the theoretical foundations of behavior in social dilemmas, and creates practical applications and solutions which can be used to improve and inform local and international governance and improve social welfare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will make several key contributions. First, it will synthesize and disseminate state-of-the art research on social dilemmas. Second, the workshop meetings foster interdisciplinary conversation and promote collaboration and the cross-fertilization of ideas across disciplinary boundaries, something which can be difficult outside of these meetings due to the traditional structure of departments and disciplinary conferences. Third, there will be a focus on identifying the emerging issues, both scientific and practical, that research should address going forward.</AbstractNarration>

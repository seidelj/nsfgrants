    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $9,000 are requested to cover the registration costs of eight US based participants in the 2016 Polymer Physics Gordon Research Conference (GRC)and associated Gordon Research Symposium (GRS) to be held on July 23-24 (GRS) and July 24-19 (GRC) at Mt Holyoke College in South Hadley MA. The combined GRC/GRS conference/seminar are held every other year. The Polymer Physics GRC is an important venue for scientific exchange in this interdisciplinary field. New experimental, simulation, and theoretical developments in both existing and emerging areas in polymer physics will be emphasized with particular focus on the influence of structure and interactions on macroscopic behavior. The associated GRS provides a complementary venue for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to interact with senior mentors, and with one another, to cultivate scientific exchange and collaborations. The themed GRC technical sessions will cover each of the following areas: Crystallization and Crystalline Polymers; Polymer-Polymer phase behavior; Structured Polymer Conductors; Block Copolymer Thin Films; Segmental, Chain and Ion Dynamics; Confined Polymers; Nanocomposites; and Ionomers. The GRS will be held the weekend before the GRC. It will comprise twelve talks delivered by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, and two poster sessions, reporting on their research, and will include a panel discussion featuring senior scientists.</AbstractNarration>

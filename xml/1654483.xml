    <AbstractNarration>Transition metal catalysis allows for the efficient and economical syntheses of organic compounds that finds widespread applications in chemical, pharmaceutical, and polymer manufacturing. In comparison to the very commonly used precious metal catalysts, catalysts based on nickel represent an inexpensive and earth-abundant alternative. In addition, nickel provides access to new types of chemical reactions and products, as well as unprecedented reactivity. In this project, Dr. Tianning Diao is conducting a fundamental study to understand how nickel forms chemical bonds between elements of importance in organic chemistry, thereby providing the basis for solving practical challenges in this critically important class of chemical reactions. In addition to training students at the interface of organic and inorganic chemistry, Dr. Diao is developing a summer workshop program to help teachers from institutions with underrepresented minority students overcome challenges in teaching science. In addition, Dr. Diao is actively engaged in creating, editing, and updating contents in ChemWiki, a free online textbook, serving students worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Diao of New York University is establishing bimolecular reductive elimination mechanisms for a variety of Ni-mediated bond formation processes. Well-defined bimetallic Ni complexes undergo oxidation to generate mixed-valent and high-valent intermediates, which rapidly proceed to form carbon-carbon, carbon-halogen, and nitrogen-nitrogen bonds. Spectroscopic characterization of Ni-Ni bonds and their roles in stabilizing reactive intermediates provide the mechanistic basis for developing new reactions for chemical synthesis. Dr. Diao is actively contributing to Chemwiki, a free online textbook, serving students worldwide, especially the financially disadvantaged. In addition, Dr. Diao is developing a summer workshop program to help enhance teaching of science at institutions with underrepresented minority students.</AbstractNarration>

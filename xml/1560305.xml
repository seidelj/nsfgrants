    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Louisiana State University (LSU)engages undergraduate students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields in energy related research with a focus on entrepreneurship and the mechanisms whereby advances in basic science are transitioned to practice. The research focus of the REU program will be structured around a common energy theme with sub-topics including energy storage, catalysis, and biofuels. A unique aspect of this REU Site is that the students will be challenged to consider strategies to advance and transform their research past the laboratory phase to real world implementation via the program's focus on industry and entrepreneurship. LSU is located in the heart of petrochemical country and has developed relationships with many of the top petroleum and chemical companies in the world. PhD engineers from several of these companies will mentor the REU students on the importance of high quality research in industry and the types of careers available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in energy related research during a 10-week summer program, on a range of projects, including: cycling new battery materials and characterizing electrolytes; quantifying and enhancing lipid production from algae; and characterizing new catalysis used to generate alcohols from syngas. In addition to active energy research projects mentored by faculty from the Colleges of Engineering and Science, students will participate in research seminars, ethics training, writing and communications training, field trips to world class research facilities, entrepreneurial activities, and career development activities. Recruitment of REU Site participants will target Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and undergraduate institutions without significant graduate STEM programs.</AbstractNarration>

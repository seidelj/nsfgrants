    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to promote the progress of science by providing student travel scholarships to attend the 23nd IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS 2015), to be held in Atlanta, GA, on Oct. 5-7, 2015. The 2005 PITAC and 2007 NSF Cyberinfrastructure Vision reports make it clear that people are key to improving computational science and research and in maintaining the competitive edge of the United States. To this end, the project aims to support about 20 students from US-based universities to attend MASCOTS 2015 by defraying travel and hotel expenses for them. The conference offers opportunities for students to interact and learn about state-of-the-art research in the areas of computer networks and performance evaluation of computer systems by bringing together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in what has become a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implication of modeling and advanced computing systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are significant growth opportunities available to the students, such as three days of technical sessions, keynotes/plenaries, panels, parallel sessions, an industrial session, and a poster reception. The goal is to improve the computing field by: exposing more students to technical experts and potential collaborators, building better relationships between students, helping students meet potential hosts for summer visits/internships, helping students meet potential post-doctoral sponsors, and encouraging the students to stay in the field. Especially, the supported students will interact with researchers who are doing key work in crucial computing areas such as systems, networking, I/O, middleware/OS, and applications. The broader impacts of the project are the opportunities for the students to gain access to contacts with academia, industry, and national laboratories, leading to useful feedback on the students' research as well as opportunities for future employment.</AbstractNarration>

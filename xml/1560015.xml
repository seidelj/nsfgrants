    <AbstractNarration>This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. The Community Geography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) REU Site hosted by the University of Central Florida will: 1) critically assess the opportunities for and challenges to community-based models for international undergraduate research experiences; 2) engage 24 students over three years in community-based international fieldwork focused on community geography, GIS, and citizen science to examine social and environmental disparities related to marine debris and flooding/disaster management in Belize; and 3) disseminate a new conceptual and methodological framework for international community geography and GIS research by connecting theory with praxis. Students will work collaboratively with a diverse group of international partners, including researchers at University of Central Florida, Georgia State University, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystems Program, and University of Belize. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of this REU Site is to provide international experiences for students in community geography and GIS that connect research to real-world problem solving that is inclusive of knowledge production from local stakeholders. Student mastery of geospatial STEM research skills will be accomplished largely through students creating an open and freely available geospatial data infrastructure to address social and environmental disparities related to marine debris and flooding/disaster management in Belize. This objective will include the creation of an online, interactive geospatial data and mapping portal through ArcGIS Online, a service providing template-based web mapping applications. This REU Site will provide free and open access to various research datasets, metadata, and geospatial training modules. The geospatial infrastructure created by students will also include: quantitative datasets, qualitative data, GPS field data, geographic analyses, and maps/reports of findings. Students will also co-lead GIS training and community-based fieldwork with Belizean residents and collaborators. This REU Site and the growing subfield of community geography and GIS contribute to several national STEM trends, including: 1) the National Science Foundation's continued emphasis on the Science of Broadening Participating in STEM; 2) NSF's efforts to increase public understanding of science and impact on broader society; and 3) rapid growth in geospatial technology careers (identified as a U.S. Dept. of Labor high-growth industry). The subfield of community geography and GIS is particularly useful for training students in international, community-based research as it provides opportunities to learn and apply geospatial STEM research skills, including GPS data collection, GIS analysis, qualitative data analysis, and geospatial database design. This project is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).</AbstractNarration>

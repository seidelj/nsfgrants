    <AbstractNarration>Across the nation, community and technical colleges offer many programs and degrees in computer networking (CN) to serve business and industry, but companies are increasingly requiring a baccalaureate degree for advanced positions. To address this need, this project at Renton Technical College (RTC) is designed to create a transferable Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree option in the Computer Network Technology (CNT) program that will facilitate the transition of students into an industry-driven Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree in Computer Network Architecture to provide the education required for these advanced positions. Through enhanced partnerships with industry, it will address the annual shortage of educated professionals in the high-demand, high-paying field of CN in the service area of the college, the majority of which require a baccalaureate degree. The college will also develop articulation agreements with area high schools to help high school students transition seamlessly into the associate degree program. The project will also recruit and retain a more diverse student as it engages with local and national groups to get advice on increasing diversity in CN programs to increase the enrollment of underserved populations, women, and veterans in these programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By adopting the Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) best practice process and curricular resources created and refined by the ATE-funded National Convergence Technology Center (CTC) (DUE 1205077), the college will ensure that its AAS and BAS degrees provide students with the latest skills and knowledge they need to gain employment in the high-demand computer network field. The project will engage local employers, students, colleges, and high schools to develop a clear and achievable plan to upgrade the AAS, create a BAS, and develop articulated pathways from high school into CN programs that build on the experiences of other ATE-funded colleges. Activities will include curriculum and course development for two degrees, in-depth consultations with industry, extensive outreach to high school and college students and instructors, professional development for 20 area high school teachers, navigation of the approval processes, and creation of the infrastructure for the BAS program. The project will deeply engage employers to improve learning outcomes at the AAS level and build a BAS degree that will directly meet their need for baccalaureate level education in CN occupations. The college will collaborate with other institutions, including the Green River College ATE-funded project Expanding Career and Educational Learning in Information Technology (DUE 1400688) and other peer colleges in the National CTC's Convergence College Network (CCN) to benefit from their experiences and speed up the adoption of processes and relevant curriculum. The leadership team will share materials and findings with others in the Washington community and technical college system and with the CCN members through presentations, publications and listservs to help others in building similar programs around the country. It will also reach out to other programs at RTC to share the BILT process and help increase partnerships with industry. Evaluation of the project will include both formative and summative elements to help ensure the project team's work with the BILT and student experiences are positive and productive.</AbstractNarration>

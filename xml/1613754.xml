<AbstractNarration>The central objective of this project is to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control how the information contained within genes is utilized by cells.  Because genes are responsible for essentially all aspects of cell and organismal biology, ranging from how cells divide to how animals respond to hormones, these studies will shed new light into processes of broad biological importance.  The project will also have a wide-reaching impact on the education of undergraduate students through the implementation of several initiatives.  First, 12 undergraduate students will be directly involved in several aspects of the research.  These students will be mentored by Dr. Duina and will be trained in a variety of laboratory and scientific skills.  Second, 30-50 undergraduate students will carry out part of this research in the context of a course Dr. Duina teaches at Hendrix College.  These students will be engaged in the excitement of science through an authentic research experience in the classroom.  Third, students in Dr. Duina's laboratory will present their research to their peers majoring in disciplines other than the sciences.  These sessions are designed to teach science students how to communicate science to the lay public as well as to expose non-scientists to the thrill of scientific inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which the transcription elongation factor Spt16 interacts with transcribed genes in vivo. Within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, DNA is compacted through the formation of a protein-DNA complex known as chromatin, the fundamental unit of which is the nucleosome.  Nucleosomes consist of a short stretch of DNA wrapped around histone octamers, themselves composed of pairs of the four core histone proteins.  Nucleosomes represent physical barriers during the process of gene transcription and Spt16, as part of the FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions (FACT) complex, has been shown to play central roles in overcoming these barriers.  In this project, Dr. Duina's laboratory will use a combination of genetic, biochemical, and targeted proteomic approaches to assess contributions of DNA sequences, histone modifications, histones, and other proteins in regulating physical interactions between Spt16 and transcribed genes.  The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used for this project, and given the high degree of evolutionary conservation in the factors and processes under investigation, results from these studies will contribute to our understanding of a process relevant to all eukaryotic organisms, including humans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.</AbstractNarration>

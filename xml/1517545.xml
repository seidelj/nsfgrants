    <AbstractNarration>The proposal aims to use observations of galaxy clusters to investigate models for dark-matter particles. Galaxy clusters can be thought of as enormous reservoirs of non-radiating, thus "dark", matter. Particles of dark matter respond to the force of gravity, but little else is known about them. Theories predict that dark-matter particles will annihilate or decay, yielding gamma-ray emission plus high-energy electrons and positrons that can radiate in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The team's models show that the products of dark-matter annihilation are best traced via their radio emission, and they will use galaxy clusters to investigate that radio linkage. The team's models also show that the products of dark-matter decay are best traced via their gamma-ray emission, and they will use galaxy clusters to investigate that gamma-ray linkage. Finally, the team will modify their models and apply them to unusual clusters that exhibit radio halos, to try to solve the long-standing problem of the halos' origin. The PI will continue her efforts at departmental, institutional, and national levels to promote the involvement of women in physics. She will expand these departmental and institutional efforts to include other underrepresented groups</AbstractNarration>

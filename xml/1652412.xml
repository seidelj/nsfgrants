    <AbstractNarration>Title: CAREER: Impacts of Marine Algal Blooms on Disinfection By-Product Formation in Seawater Desalination&lt;br/&gt;PI Name: Ning Dai &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1652412&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reverse osmosis (RO)-based seawater desalination is one of the most important technologies for meeting the growing global water demand. At the intake of RO desalination plants, disinfectants (e.g., chlorine) are often added to suppress fouling of the treatment units, especially RO membranes, by microorganisms. These disinfectants can react with marine organic matter to form harmful disinfection by-products (DBPs). Recently, marine algal blooms were shown to interrupt desalination operations by causing severe membrane fouling, as a result of the high concentration of algal organic matter (AOM) during algal blooms. While disinfectants are crucial for controlling fouling during algal blooms, the implications of high AOM concentrations on DBP formation in desalination have not been considered. In this project the PI will investigate the formation of DBPs from algae species relevant to marine algal blooms and will develop DBP mitigation strategies for desalination operations. Education activities will focus on promoting professional competencies of environmental engineering students at all degree levels and on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on both the fundamentals of DBP formation from marine algae and the application of findings to desalination operations. The project will encompass four research objectives. First, the DBP formation potential of bloom-relevant marine algae species will be evaluated under conditions simulating disinfection in seawater desalination during algal blooms. Representative species will be selected based on their relevance to marine algal blooms along the US coasts. The algae culture and the extracted intra- and extra-cellular AOM will be subjected to a suite of disinfectants, chlorine, chloramine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, permanganate, and their combinations. Second, DBP formation will be evaluated for fresh AOM derived from different algae growth stages and aged AOM after biotic and abiotic transformation. Third, the mechanisms of DBP formation from marine algae cells and the important DBP precursors will be identified. The fundamental knowledge of DBP formation under desalination scenario will be the basis for designing DBP prevention strategies for desalination facilities. Lastly, the effects of AOM transformation upon disinfection on its membrane fouling potential will be characterized to suggest strategies to achieve a balance between membrane fouling control and DBP prevention. Analytical tools such as gas, liquid, and size exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, and spectrophotometry will be employed to monitor DBP formation and characterize AOM transformation. The integral educational activities will include graduate student training in research and mentoring, providing research experience for undergraduates, incorporating cooperative design project-based learning in graduate and undergraduate environmental engineering courses, and K-12 outreach focusing on high school and middle school teacher development.</AbstractNarration>

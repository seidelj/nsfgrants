    <AbstractNarration>One key limit to spectrum utilization efficiency involves the current practice of half-duplex communication, in which a node cannot transmit and receive on the same frequency at the same time. Some recent studies have provided experimental evidence and methodologies for full-duplex communication. To date, however, all full-duplex demonstrations have been predicated on the principle that the transmitter and the receiver must generate their own radio-carrier waves independently, which in practice results in a high level of self-interference at both nodes. The objective of this CAREER project is to create reliable full-duplex wireless networks by means of reflected power.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will pursue backscatter modulation, where electromagnetic waves are modulated and reflected by the same antenna that receives them. Within this framework, the end-user receives a signal free of self-interference. This research offers a new paradigm for two-way wireless networks: rather than avoiding self-interference as in half-duplex -- or combating self-interference as in full-duplex -- nodes will re-use the received interfering radio-carrier waves to transfer information. The results of this analysis will advance the knowledge of antenna scattering for a wide range of applications. The proposed implementation in hardware will incite an exchange between algorithm innovation and hardware implementation, pushing the limit of spectrum-efficiency communication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will also embed the proposed research into pedagogy by creating a center of wireless communications at Purdue University Calumet. The center will provide a range of opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to gain direct experience in testing, evaluating, and improving backscatter modulation for full-duplex communications. Given the current pervasiveness of two-way wireless communication, the results of this research can be used to significantly increase the spectral efficiency of future wireless networks.</AbstractNarration>

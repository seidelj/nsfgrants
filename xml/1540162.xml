    <AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for 12 US-based junior researchers to participate in the International Workshop on Elliptic and Kinetic Differential Equations, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, July 6-17, 2015 at IMPA (Instituto Nacional de Matematica Pura e Aplicada). The workshop is an important part of the thematic program "Current Trends in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations" taking place at IMPA from July through September, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop brings together leading experts in analysis and partial differential equations to deliver 10 introductory mini-courses (each with 3 lectures) over a period of two weeks, presenting a perspective on the current trends on selected research topics and promoting interaction among researchers with different areas of expertise. In addition to the mini-courses, the PI will deliver a series of lectures on "Obstacle-Type Free Boundary Problems." The main focus of the workshop is on the development of graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and other junior researchers with diverse backgrounds, particularly those from under-represented groups. More information of the workshop can be found at http://www.impa.br/opencms/en/eventos/store/evento_1505</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The APEC Cooperation for Earthquake Simulation (ACES) is a multi-lateral grand challenge science research cooperation of APEC (the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation). ACES was originally founded to develop realistic supercomputer simulation models for the complete earthquake generation process and to assimilate observations into such models. Subsequent meetings have also broadened the topics to include simulations of tsunamis, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, mantle convection, and other geodynamically interesting topics. The founding member economies of ACES are Australia, China, Japan and the United States. Subsequently, three other economies have requested and attained membership in ACES, including Canada, New Zealand, and Chinese Taipei. This meetingwill continue the tradition of cutting-edge science in support of earthquake risk reduction. Travel support for US scientists, in particular for early career and under-represented groups, will contribute to the intellectual development of this critical field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop support will allow US students and participants to travel to the ACES Symposium on Earthquakes, Tsunamis, and other Multihazards, to be held in Chengdu, China, August 10-14, with a field trip to visit the site of the May 12, 2008 M8 Wenchuan, China earthquake during August 15-16. The meeting is a multilateral meeting of many APEC economies, whose participants are scientists and technologists interested in computer modeling and simulation of earthquake and other natural disasters. US participation is jointly supported with NASA. Products from the symposium will include a proceedings volume of peer-reviewed papers, similar to the many publications volumes produced from the previous meetings.An example of potential impact is the Global National Satellite System Tsunami Early Warning System project proposed by NASA. ACES is now playing a critical role in the leadership and implementation of this project, through its role as an approved scientific activity of the APEC Policy Partnership on Science, Technology and Innovation.</AbstractNarration>

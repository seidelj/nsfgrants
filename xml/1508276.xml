    <AbstractNarration>Current ocean field research activity is dominated by the Research Vessel paradigm. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are now available and have been maturing for ocean sensing but are range limited plus have limits in payload capacity and duration. Improvements in ocean robotics and their coupling to manned systems (research vessels) are needed in order to accelerate ocean going ship activities. The proposed innovation is to enable mobile networks (multi-agent system) of high speed, high power robotic surface vehicles outfitted with sensors (real time sensing) and novel robotic samplers for post sample processing. The robotic surface vessels are enabled by the proposed automation kit designated MARCON: (Mobile, Autonomous and Remotely Controlled Observation Node), a cheaper more lightweight and open-source automation system for surface vehicles. The broader impact of this technology is its ability to impact the data collection and quality of the various parameters to understand any aquatic ecosystem. The market for automated mapping of the waterways is growing because of the push to move observations out of laboratories into decentralized settings. Implementation of fast automated mapping of key and new parameters will not only impact the management of ecosystems, but can reduce time in and costs, which will result in a more efficient environmental management process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed technology is its ability to transform the field of ocean/lakes/river observations. Further, deficiencies in ship-based research such as aliasing in time and space, efficient large area coverage, stress at sea for humans, lack of persistence on the water, and ability to adaptively respond over a large area, can all be improved with robotic augmented ship operations. Ocean researchers in the US will benefit from this work. In addition, the ability to adaptively respond to fronts, blooms, extreme events (hurricanes, radioactive releases, etc) and oil spills will be enhanced. The key features of making these proposed kits available to the market place include: distributed fleets of robotic surface vehicles to enable a new Research Vessel System; a robotic vehicle for speedy sensing/sampling of waterways and power for maximum sensor hosting; an end-end solution for automated high content data generation and visualization; advanced adaptive sensing and sampling approach; accessible open source technology for rapid adoption and diffusion of the automation kit and boat platform.</AbstractNarration>

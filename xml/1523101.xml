    <AbstractNarration>Many mobile devices with GPS-positioning capabilities allow users to retrieve and share their geographical coordinates and such geospatial data is critical in many areas including traffic optimization, emergency response, disaster rescue missions or military intelligence. At the same time, there are serious concerns related to the security, privacy and trustworthiness (SPT) of the data since users disclose their coordinates and an adversary could derive sensitive information violating users' privacy, or could change the data leading, for example, to wrong conclusions in a crime investigation. SPT for geospatial data has been a subject of intensive research and its results have been gradually transferred into market products. However, there has been no transition to education and this project intends to build capacity for geospatial SPT education by developing six course modules. They will cover geospatial SPT from several different perspectives, with focus on data management, networking, data mining, and social issues. The modules can be integrated into upper-level high-school, community college, or university courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissemination plan includes workshops, seminars and other outreach activities at high schools, community colleges and universities to increase awareness on geospatial SPT issues and to disseminate project's resources to a broad audience. It is expected that the proposed course modules will be also used in other fields such as law, economics, sociology and other disciplines where mobile technology introduces new opportunities but also considerable challenges. The project intends to reach students from underrepresented groups through collaboration with institutions in the Pathways to Prosperity network.</AbstractNarration>

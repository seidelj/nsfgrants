    <AbstractNarration>A better understanding of the full life cycle of star clusters, from birth to death, is important for many areas of astronomy, including the formation and evolution of galaxies, the initial stellar mass function, the fraction of stars forming in clusters, and for understanding whether the conditions for star formation in the early universe when now-ancient globular clusters were young are the same as they are today. The goal of this program is to shed light on two as-yet poorly understood epochs in the life cycle of a star cluster -- just before they are born and very soon after they form.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program supports the training of a postdoctoral researcher. Results from the research done for this project will be used in age-appropriate, hands-on, activities as part of 'Girls in Science', an all-day outreach event aimed to foster middle-school girls' interest in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will study the formation of star clusters, and also their destruction, in nearby galaxies. Star cluster formation is one of the most fundamental processes in galaxies, and occurs over an incredibly diverse range of environments and physical conditions, far broader than those found in the Milky Way alone. Clusters are born in the dense parts of giant clouds of molecular gas, and many are subsequently dispersed by several different physical processes. The goal of this program is to shed light on two as-yet poorly understood epochs in the life cycle of a star cluster -- just before they are born and very soon after they form. Observations with the National Science Foundation's new Atacama Large Millimeter Array enable direct study of clouds in distant galaxies covering a much wider range of physical conditions than our nearest neighbors. The properties of these clouds, particularly their mass functions, when compared with those of young star clusters in the same galaxy, provide important clues to understand the efficiency with which stars and clusters form under different physical conditions. Even as clusters are forming within molecular clouds, the energy and momentum injected by newly born massive stars pushes out left-over interstellar material, which eventually shuts off star formation and leaves many young clusters gravitationally unbound. Physical constraints on this process are poor, but measurements of the ionized gas both inside and outside of very young clusters using observations with the newly commissioned Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) will distinguish between different predictions.</AbstractNarration>

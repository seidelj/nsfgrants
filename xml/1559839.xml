    <AbstractNarration>Professor Jennifer Brodbelt and colleagues at the University of Texas at Austin host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site supported by the REU Sites Program of the Chemistry Division. This is an undergraduate research program aimed at interdisciplinary training of future scientific leaders. The projects focus on advanced research in the chemistry of materials, including biomaterials, materials for energy conversion, and the characterization of chemicals and materials. Eight undergraduates from universities around the United States participate in a ten-week summer program that couples intensive training and research-focused mentoring in a way that enhances retention of students in science and engineering. The special emphasis on scientific communication and inclusion of a multi-faceted safety program prepares undergraduates for graduate school or jobs in science, technology and engineering fields. The broader impact of this work is the exposure and involvement of undergraduates, including those from underrepresented groups, to the overarching theme of chemistry of materials and its impact on the world via hands-on training with state-of-the-art spectroscopic, synthetic, and processing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program joins chemists and chemical engineers to encompass the discovery, design, development and characterization of new materials. Research efforts in the area of biomaterials draws on integration of concepts related to evaluation of biocompatibility and toxicology, mechanical and structural properties, and ultimately biofunction. The discovery of alternative energy materials represents a critical objectives to alleviate the consequences of relying on carbon-based fuels. One focus is on discovery of more efficient photovoltaic materials, development of catalytic methods for hydrogen production, storage and delivery, and the development of new devices for solar energy capture and conversion. The development of new analytical/physical methods, application of those methods for characterization of biomaterials and energy materials, and assessment of performance metrics are key goals. Some of the undergraduates co-author papers from the emerging research, and faculty engage in mentoring scientists at the earliest stages of their technical development.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need pursuing bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of academically talented, low-income students. The project aims to provide a seamless graduation pathway for academically talented yet economically disadvantaged students. In recognition of the varied types of support needed by individual students, the program will utilize a holistic framework of evidence-based effective practices to ensure that the challenges particular to each scholar are addressed. Scholarships and support for academically strong students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic vitality of the greater Milwaukee region and the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program organization is informed by research indicating that significant reasons for STEM attrition include poor classroom experiences of students, lack of faculty mentoring, and an unsupportive campus atmosphere. The proposal will test the idea that strong faculty mentoring and advising, community-oriented activities, undergraduate research opportunities, and selective participation in student organizations and professional societies will reduce isolation, increase connectedness, and improve STEM career commitment for talented low-income students whose initial connection to the university may be limited. The holistic framework established in this project builds on a variety of existing student support activities including pre-orientation and summer bridge programs, tutoring, a living-learning community, internship and undergraduate research opportunities, and participation in student organizations and professional societies. Scholars will have mentors who are experienced engineering and computer science faculty. An active cohort of scholars engaged in career development and community-oriented activities will help establish a supportive climate. The project will utilize the resources available in the industries located in the Milwaukee region. In addition to the opportunity for industrial internships, scholars will have industrial mentors. These mentors from industry will help students learn about the nature of the opportunities available in their prospective careers in engineering and computer science. The project has identified commitment to career goals as an important element in student persistence and anticipates that industrial mentoring combined with faculty and other career advising will improve student understanding of the prospects of their intended majors. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and help increase understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.</AbstractNarration>

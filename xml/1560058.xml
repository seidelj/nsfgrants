    <AbstractNarration>This three year renewal of a successful Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of New Mexico, entitled REU in Nanoscience and Microsystems Engineering, focuses on the application of nanomaterials to biosystems and bioimaging as well as to energy conversion and storage, representing areas of current national interest. The synthesis and processing of materials in the 21st century requires a new paradigm where the physical sciences, engineering and computational modeling come together. Solving some of the most pressing challenges in the areas of health, energy and the environment provides challenging research projects for this REU Site. The unique aspect of this program is the interdisciplinary environment, which is an essential component of materials research. The interdisciplinary team-based approach reflects the environment these students will encounter as they transition to their careers in industry, academe or in national labs. The Nanoscience and Microsystems interdisciplinary program is based on the premise that to benefit society the unique properties of nanoscale materials must be integrated into micro- and macro-scale devices and then further into systems. Projects include drug delivery, biocides, protein aggregation and sensing, nanoparticle dynamics, catalysts, nano fluidics and energy conversion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be recruited from diverse ethnic, educational as well as cultural backgrounds. This includes students from community colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions across the country. Students work for 10 summer weeks with a research advisor and a mentor (graduate student/post-doc). The aim is to instill a spirit of inquiry by integrating research and education, and to enhance student interest in pursuing careers in the sciences and engineering. Students are guided through all aspects of research, preparing a proposal, making a plan of research, executing this plan and analyzing and presenting the significance of their work. In this manner, students transition from a relatively dependent status to one where they start to ask questions and suggest new experiments. Students also participate in a series of seminars that will include faculty, national lab and industry speakers. Field trips to the National Laboratories and to local industries enhance their exposure to career opportunities and exciting research problems. The summer research program provides students the excitement of participating in open-ended research, at the same time connecting this research with their academic curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

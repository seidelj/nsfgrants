    <AbstractNarration>This award renews funding of WiscSIMS as a national, multi-user facility for stable isotope geochemistry. Applications of the lab's new in situ capabilities for microanalysis of stable isotopes and trace elements are potentially transformative in many areas of earth sciences and have importance for subjects of societal concern including development of energy and mineral resources; evaluating volcanic hazards; documenting climate change and paleoclimate; and environmental remediation. Technology transfer is an important activity of this lab. WiscSIMS has published many peer-reviewed reports of new technological and scientific developments that are being applied by the private sector that enable the larger research community to study how our planet works. Research at WiscSIMS also includes many studies driven solely by intellectual curiosity, including the genesis of the solar system, the origin of life, and the history of Earth. Education is emphasized as part of the routine operation of this facility, involving high school students and science teachers with the Univ. of Wisconsin People Program, a pre-college pipeline for students of color and low-income students, and the NASA Astrobiology Institute. WiscSIMS staff often communicate with the media, and contribute to web sites, open houses, and exhibitions at the UW-Madison Geology Museum, which has 40,000 visitors/year. In addition, we teach regular courses in Stable Isotope Geochemistry and Environmental Isotopes, and we train undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. In the past 6 years, WiscSIMS trained 63 students including 33 women and four minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WiscSIMS has optimized an IMS-1280 large-radius, multi-collector ion microprobe (SIMS) for analysis of stable isotopes (including Li, C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, and Fe). WiscSIMS has developed unique capabilities for precise and accurate analysis of isotope ratios from small to ultra small spots. The ability to analyze small spots (1-10 micron) in situ from microscope mounts allows data to be put in context with imaging and other forms of analysis. The applications of these new in situ capabilities are potentially transformative in many areas of geochemistry. The range and pattern of isotope variation can finally be determined from small objects that were formerly homogenized by analysis of bulk or powdered samples such as zircons, microfossils, mineral inclusions, quartz overgrowths, and carbonates. The three most common areas of research that are enabled by WiscSIMS are Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology &amp; Geochemistry; Cosmochemistry &amp; Astrobiology; and Low Temperature Geochemistry &amp; Paleoclimatology. Over 50% of instrument beam-time has been devoted to earth science and NSF-supported projects. NSF-funded projects receive the highest priority and a reduced-fee schedule. It is not necessary for guests to have previous SIMS experience. Thus far, over 300 scientists have worked with WiscSIMS from 65 different universities and research institutes.</AbstractNarration>

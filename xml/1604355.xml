<AbstractNarration>1604355 - Porfiri&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robotic devices have been playing an increasingly central role in physical rehabilitation due to their capability to support an increasing range of therapeutic treatments, minimize therapist time commitment, and record the performance of patients. To further extend rehabilitation treatments beyond clinical settings and enhance rehabilitation progress, considerable effort has been devoted toward robot-mediated telerehabilitation, which allows a physical therapist to remotely monitor and supervise several patients simultaneously. However, the cost of these devices and the repetitive nature of the prescribed exercises have significantly hampered the practicality of robot-mediated telerehabilitation. This project will open new directions for transforming robot-mediated telerehabilitation, through the integration of therapeutic treatments with low-cost haptic devices and interactive online citizen science activities. In the envisioned paradigm, participants will contribute to citizen science by performing activities that are part of their therapeutic regiment, and consequently increase the time spent on otherwise-boring rehabilitation activities. This integration is expected to not only contribute to scientific research but also increase patient self-esteem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program seeks to advance upper limb robot-mediated telerehabilitation for patients recovering from stroke by empowering them through active science participation. The envisioned system comprises a low-cost haptic joystick interfaced to a PC, which affords online social interactions in a citizen science research project. Patients will contribute to an environmental monitoring citizen science project developed by the research team, by analyzing images acquired by an aquatic mobile robot in a polluted canal in Brooklyn, NY, while interacting with other patients online. By harnessing the motivation and interests of patients in science and the environment, the proposed approach aims to maximize retention and efforts towards rehabilitation. The analysis will be performed using a haptic joystick, which provides a force-feedback to the patient while recording salient rehabilitation performance indices for upper limb rehabilitation. The system will be tested on both healthy subjects and patients undergoing rehabilitation for post-stroke hemiparesis through a series of experimental studies that elucidates the combined effects of force feedback and social interactions on patient performance and satisfaction.</AbstractNarration>

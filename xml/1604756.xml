    <AbstractNarration>1604756 &lt;br/&gt;Huang, Yinlun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop a theoretic framework for modeling technology-driven transition toward sustainability for industrial systems and derive optimal development strategies under uncertainties. Sustainable development is a process that targets a future state of sustainability for industries, the environment, and societies. Sustainable development is the pathway to sustainability, which is chiefly featured by a system's transition from one state to another toward sustainability goals. This project is designed provide scientific answers to the following questions: Is a preset sustainability goal achievable under known constraints? If yes, how to manage the state transition process in an optimal way? If no, then how to set an achievable sustainability goal, or how to identify the main obstacle(s) so that the preset goal becomes achievable? In this GOALI project, Wayne State University and BASF researchers will jointly study key fundamental aspects of sustainable development of industrial systems, namely triple-bottom-line-balanced development (economic, environmental, social) and goal achievability under uncertainty. The theoretic framework and engineering methodology to be developed should be valuable for studying a wide spectrum of sustainability problems in any industry and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives are to (i) develop a theoretic framework for technology-driven system transition toward sustainability, (ii) generate a unique engineering method for designing sustainable and controllable systems, (iii) derive optimal development strategies that allow decision makers' active participation, and (iv) construct a software tool embedding the design method, which will be used to study sophisticated industrial sustainability problems through collaboration with BASF. The project will use a vector analysis technique to analyze the sustainability state transition problem, and to apply the supervisory-regulatory control technique to formulate and manage the sustainability state transition process. The project will generate educational materials for enhancing an introductory course on sustainable engineering open to all engineering students at WAyne State University. The methodology and the tool will be disseminated through the Sustainable Manufacturing Advances in Research and Technology (SMART) Coordination Network that the PI chairs, and the AIChE Sustainable Engineering Forum, as well as publication. Short courses and seminars will be arranged with industry. The developed case studies and computer tool will be structured for use by the students in the NSF REU site program - Summer Academy in Sustainable Engineering at Wayne State University.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology, the exploitation of the science of the very small, has the potential to revolutionize lives - a few examples include faster electronics, smaller biomedical implants, better batteries, materials with high strength or the ability to self-clean, and small machines that can sense the physical world. Often, nanotechnology development requires access to a large fabrication and characterization infrastructure and the related scientific expertise to allow users to build and measure such nanomaterials and nanodevices. This project establishes a Mid-Atlantic Nanotechnology Hub (MANTH) for Research, Education, and Innovation at the University of Pennsylvania as a NNCI site. This site will allow users in the mid-Atlantic region, the nation's fifth largest economic area, to access the Singh Center for Nanotechnology, where they can perform nanofabrication and measurement tasks, and interact with nanotechnology experts. The Singh Center is located at the University of Pennsylvania in downtown Philadelphia, and is highly accessible to over 100 regional academic institutions and the industry-rich mid-Atlantic region. The Singh Center will also host education programs to introduce high school students, college undergraduates, and the Philadelphia area community to nanotechnology. These potential future nanotechnologists will have the opportunity to participate in Nano Day and Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates programs held on-site; view nanotechnology contributions to community outreach programs such as Philly Materials Day and the Philadelphia Science Festival; and participate in workforce training activities for nanotechnology technicians carried out in partnership with the Community College of Philadelphia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MANTH will enable access to leading-edge research and development facilities and expertise for academic, government, and industry researchers conducting activities within all disciplines of nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. Examples of its capabilities include: electron-beam, photo-, imprint- and soft-lithographies; material deposition and etching; multiscale 3D printing; laser micromachining; electron and scanning probe microscopy; tip-based nanofabrication; and ion and electron beam milling. This NNCI site will foster intellectual collaboration by assisting users in addressing their nanoscience and application needs; providing a forum for intellectual exchange between academic and industry users; and developing new fabrication processes that not only contribute to the users end application but also further the fields of nanofabrication and nanomanufacturing. Users will also benefit from interaction with Penn faculty and staff, possessing significant expertise in nanofabrication; flexible/stretchable nanodevices; MEMS; microfluidics, photonics, and electronics; fabrication and exploitation of nanostructured soft materials systems; multiple low-dimensional materials; characterization and integration of beyond-silicon material systems; and investigations at the nano-bio interface, from medical devices to enabling the understanding of biological systems. In addition to serving existing researchers, MANTH will engage potential future nanotechnologists through on-site research reviews, summer research experiences, and outreach to local Philadelphia high schools. By acting as a catalyst for growth of nanotechnology in this region, significant opportunities for nanotechnologists at all levels will be created, from technicians through a workforce development partnership with the Community College of Philadelphia to Ph.D. researchers.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>PI: Hochberg, Leigh R. &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1504663&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret neural signals to provide users with a new method for controlling external devices. BMIs have the potential to improve the quality of life for millions of individuals around the world with neurological impairments leading to paralysis or limb loss, enabling the restoration of communication, movement, or sensory function. The development of this technology is a multidisciplinary endeavor, involving scientists, engineers, computer scientists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. The 2015 International Workshop of Clinical Brain-Machine Interfaces (CBMI), to be held at Nadao Hall, Tokyo, Japan, will provide a venue for students and professionals from diverse backgrounds to learn from each other and to develop a strategy to translate BMIs from research laboratories to the clinic. This award is being made jointly by three Programs. (1) Biomedical Engineering, in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Division (Engineering Directorate); (2) General and Age-Related Disabilities Engineering, in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Division (Engineering Directorate); and (3) Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI) (Engineering Directorate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2015 CBMI conference will convene expert speakers and leaders in clinical BMI research, including rehabilitation clinicians, neurologists, neurosurgeons, engineers, neuroscientists, regulatory scientists and industry representatives. Beyond the keynote and plenary lectures, the conference will ensure ample time for discussion and workshops on topics including: BMIs in the home; roadmaps for BMI research in the US, Europe, and Asia; combining neuromodulation and BMI strategies; neuroethical and legal dimensions of BMI research; and many others. At the conclusion of the meeting, a Consensus Report for disseminating the findings of the international workshop will be prepared and submitted for peer-review to Frontiers in Neuroprosthetics -- a first-tier electronic open access journal devoted to studies of BMI and neuroprosthetics.</AbstractNarration>

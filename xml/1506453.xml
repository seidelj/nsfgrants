    <AbstractNarration>This award supports theoretical research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), with the aim of improving the sensitivity of LIGO detectors. Research carried out during this project explores the fundamental quantum and gravitational physics that underlie gravitational-wave detectors, and the results will be widely relevant to the more general community of quantum optomechanics. This project will be carried out at professor Yanbei Chen's research group at the California Institute of Technology; it will serve as a training ground for young gravitational-wave scientists --- by exposing them to a variety of research topics, ranging from quantum measurement theory to classical statistical physics. Members of Chen's research group will interact closely with members of the LIGO Lab, and the rest of the LIGO Scientific collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically: (A) New techniques of reducing LIGO's quantum noise will be explored, including the use of active quantum optomechanical devices, the employment of optical rigidity generated by multiple optical modes, and the possible application of active medium. The domain of applicability of the so-called Energetic Quantum Limit for quantum measurements will be critically studied. (B) Research on advanced interferometer configurations will be carried out; in particular, the feasibility and merit of switching interferometer configurations during signal arrival will be investigated; the effect of optical-mode imperfection on calibration will be evaluated; a framework for evaluating upgrade strategies for Advanced LIGO interferometers will be established. (C) Theoretical investigations on thermal fluctuations of anistoropic coating materials and non-equilibrium cryogenic suspension systems will be carried out. (D) Strategies of testing fundamental quantum and gravitational physics using macroscopic test masses and quantum-limited measurements will be formulated.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>1522109&lt;br/&gt;Kelly, William J.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This travel award will enable US scientists and engineers (including two graduate students) from the Biochemical Technology Division (BIOT) of the American Chemical Society (ACS) to participate in the 3rd European Congress of Applied Biotechnology (ECAB3). ECAB3 will be held in conjunction with the 10th European Congress of Chemical Engineering (ECCE10) in Nice, France from September 27 - Oct 1, 2015. ECAB3/ECCE10 will also be held in conjunction with the 5th European Process Intensification Conference (EPIC5). The global theme for the conference is "Chemical and biochemical engineering for a new sustainable process industry in Europe".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A goal for ECAB3 is to have BIOT partner with the European Section of Biochemical Engineering Science to provide an integrated program featuring US and European speakers in three important technical areas: Downstream Processing, Biopharmaceutical Production and Biocatalysis/Biotransformation. An additional goal is to create a student program that involves European students as well as US students. The cross-cultivation of scientific ideas from US to Europe will form a basis for dialogue and potential collaboration to expedite the advancement of biotechnology processes and products.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>PI: Daniel R. Noguera&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1506820&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major challenge facing the production of biofuels from plant biomass is the presence of unwanted byproducts resulting from the conversion of the cellulosic portions of the biomass to fermentable sugars. These byproducts, primarily from the water soluble lignin fraction of the biomass, are toxic to the fermentation process, and reduce biofuel production yield. This project will investigate the use of bacteria to convert these byproducts into a single aromatic compound which can be recovered as a valued co-product in an engineered biological process without consuming the valuable sugars. The course of this research will also advance fundamental understanding on how related anaerobic microbial processes affect the natural carbon cycle. Other impacts of the project include educational activities related to mentoring high school, undergraduate, and graduate students on topics related to the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this proposed research is to study the potential of anaerobic bacteria to convert plant-derived aromatic compounds found in cellulosic biomass hydrolysates into a single phenolic compound that can be recovered as a valued co-product in a cellulosic biorefinery. The proposed approach takes advantage of anaerobic microbial degradation of aromatic compounds, and in particular, the metabolism of cultured members of the Rhodopseudomonas genus that are effective at consuming a large variety of aromatic compounds without utilizing the sugars needed for biofuel production. It is hypothesized that the aromatics present in the hydrolysates are degraded R. palustris through the benzoyl-CoA pathway. The proposed research will genetically engineer this organism to transform the large diversity of aromatics typically present in biomass hydrolysates to either benzoic acid or p-hydroxybenzoic acid, depending on the location of the mutation. The metabolic diversity of an existing Rhodopseudomonas collection will be tested to identify the best strains for detoxification of cellulosic hydrolysates. Experiments will be carried out with a mixture of the Rhodopseudomonas strains under phototrophic and denitrifying conditions, using both corn stover hydrolysates prepared with industrially relevant biomass loadings as well as variations of a synthetic medium that simulates the hydrolysate. The genetic and regulatory networks of anaerobic aromatic degradation in the best performing Rhodopseudomonas strains will be reconstructed, using RNA-Seq and genome re-sequencing. Once the strain has been engineered to promote the biotransformation of aromatics as benzoic acid, the rate processes for removal of aromatic compounds from cellulosic hydrolysates and the recovery of the benzoic acid co-product will be studied in bioreactor systems. Research outcomes will be used to enhance content for three courses in the Environmental Engineering program at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</AbstractNarration>

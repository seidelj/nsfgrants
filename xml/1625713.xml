<AbstractNarration>Most statistical concepts are taught within an already packed secondary mathematics curriculum by mathematics teachers who are often underprepared to teach statistics. To address this issue, the Enhancing Statistics Teacher Education with E-Modules [ESTEEM] project will facilitate the infusion of statistics content and pedagogy into undergraduate mathematics teacher preparation by providing faculty with technological and curricular resources, networking experiences, and ongoing support. The ESTEEM project will address recent trends in secondary education and teacher preparation, including: 1) use of dynamic statistics tools to analyze data; 2) a shift to mobile technology which has caused schools to favor online software requiring no installation; and 3) the rapid expansion of online and hybrid courses in higher education. As a result of the ESTEEM project, preservice secondary mathematics teachers [PSMTs] will be better equipped to teach statistics with online tools. This will lead to stronger preparation of grades 6-12 students in statistics and data literacy, and feed the pipeline into data intensive STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ESTEEM project will address three primary goals. First, the project will create online resources to support preservice teachers' learning of statistics content, pedagogy, and technology tools. Videos of teachers and students engaged in statistics, and expert discussions will be created. Second, the project will design modules and approaches for the preparation of PSMTs. Newly created resources, videos, and materials will be packaged into different online modules and courses. Modules and resources will be disseminated through professional organizations, and ESTEEM will host faculty professional learning seminars prior to national professional conferences. Third, the ESTEEM project will examine how resources and modules are integrated into undergraduate curriculum, examine how well prepared PSMTs are to teach statistics content, and explore sustainable models for institutions using online resources and modules. ESTEEM's solutions to packaging online resources and e-modules will better equip mathematics teacher educators with curricular resources. ESTEEM evaluation and research will provide greater insights into the nature of PSMTs' understandings of content and pedagogy of specific statistical topics; how PSMTs design Common Online Data Analysis Platform [CODAP] based statistics activities; what activities and resources best support PSMTs' learning to teach statistics; and determining effective and sustainable models for packaging online resources for use in other STEM teacher education programs.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to perform a preliminary exploration into the design of an end-to-end mHealth system for detecting the fatigue state among individuals by leveraging eye movements. Real-time detection of fatigue state is important for a wide range of applications including reducing medical errors, reducing motor vehicle operator errors, and improving overall health and wellness for the general public. Despite these benefits, there is no widely available method for predicting fatigue in the natural environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we are designing a real-time analytics engine that provides general computational methods for inferring fatigue by fusing raw time-series data about various eye measures (saccades, fixations, blinks, and pupil dilation). This work includes a novel fatigue detector for natural settings that address robustness to real-world variability, individual differences, and confounders, and develops time-series pattern extraction methods to characterize temporal progression of fatigue state. We are also performing a pilot evaluation of our design for a student population. We envisage that a successful pilot will lead to more extensive studies involving medical residents, motor vehicle operators, shift workers, and other user groups where fatigue is a significant safety or health issue. This project includes outreach including a two day mobile sensing-themed workshop for middle school students. The workshop is offered at the UMass Amherst campus and builds on an existing outreach partnership with Girls Inc. of Holyoke, MA. that is aimed at addressing the widely recognized under-representation of women in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical&lt;br/&gt;DNA is a well-known biomolecule with a double helix structure. Recently, DNA has been folded into a wide variety of 2D and 3D shapes beyond the double helix, producing interesting materials for engineering or pharmaceutical purposes. However, once assembled, the folded DNA shapes are fixed. This CAREER award investigates how to fold DNA on the fly, creating materials that could change properties on cue. For example, folding DNA on the fly would allow for materials to be folded up for transport through the body and later unfolded for activation at a particular time or place, improving drug delivery and biotechnology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader goals of the proposal are to train a diverse set of students for careers in science. To do this, the proposal first calls for developing interdisciplinary, "plug and play" classroom laboratories. These labs can be "plugged" into different courses across many departments and "played" on a single day. Interdisciplinary training in this way has been shown to increase on-the-job, problem-solving abilities. Second, the proposal calls for increasing diversity by partnering with the Association of Women in Science (AWIS) to create media and mentoring networks that recruit, retain, and train students for science careers. Increasing diversity in science is needed to meet the demands for a technologically savvy workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical&lt;br/&gt;DNA is an important biomaterial that easily self-assembles into a wide variety of 2D and 3D supramolecular structures. However, once assembled, these structures are often static. Engineering DNA assemblies to respond to proteins would allow for dynamic changes in regulatory behavior, structure, or mechanical properties. This CAREER award proposes a novel biomimetic approach to create reconfigurable DNA assemblies using the remodeling proteins in the cell that typically fold, shape, and loop the DNA. Specifically, experiments will-for the first time- directly measure the pathway and underlying energetics of single DNA molecules as they assemble in vitro in the presence of a remodeling protein, protamine. Understanding this complex reconfiguration will be an important pioneering step in producing DNA-based nanomaterials with exquisite regulatory, structural, or mechanical control.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposal is to increase the interdisciplinary training and diversity of undergraduate students entering science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). To increase interdisciplinary training, research laboratory training modules will be developed into "plug and play" soft matter teaching laboratories that can be "plugged" into a broad range of courses in multiple departments and "played" on a single day. In addition, the proposal calls for partnering with the Advanced Laboratory Physics Association to train instructors on how to implement the laboratories. Interdisciplinary training has been shown to increase creativity and the ability to take risks, important for on-the-job, complex problem solving. To increase diversity, the proposal calls for partnering with the Association of Women in Science (AWIS) to create recruitment media with diverse scientists, a local peer mentoring network to retain students, and a series of career brochures to prepare students for STEM careers. Increasing diversity in STEM is a priority for the NSF as the US population becomes more diverse and the demands for a technologically savvy workforce are increased.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>From January fifth through January ninth of 2015, ``A Conference on Algebraic, Topological and Enumerative Combinatorics" will be held at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. This conference will provide an opportunity for established experts and early career mathematicians to share ideas and results in the field of algebraic, enumerative and topological combinatorics. Combinatorics is the study of discrete, usually finite, mathematical structures. Examples of such structures are networks, such as the internet, phone systems and transportation systems. While finite structures are in principle easy to understand through exhaustive examination, this becomes practically impossible once the structures become too large. Thus more theoretical approaches are necessary. Practitioners in the field bring to bear techniques from various areas of mathematics that involve abstraction beyond what one might expect given the nature of the problems at hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature talks on topics at the forefront of current research in the field. Among the likely topics of discussion both in talks and informal discussions are connections between combinatorics and various other areas, including algebraic geometry, topology, commutative algebra, representation theory and probability. Further information on the conference can be found at the conference website&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.math.miami.edu/~galloway/wachsfest.html</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Title: Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop at SPLASH 2015 (PLMW@SPLASH)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Programming Languages Mentoring Workshop (PLMW) at SPLASH will take place on October 27 2015, as part of the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications (SPLASH), held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. This grant will support approximately 15 students to attend the PLMW event plus the SPLASH conference. While there is other funding available (through ACM SIGPLAN PAC) for students who are presenting papers at SPLASH, this proposal is intended specifically to target undergraduate and Masters students, with a view to increasing the numbers of such students in programming languages research. The selection process further ensures a diverse pool of applicants, paying attention to underrepresented groups, and prioritizing US citizens and permanent residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena.</AbstractNarration>

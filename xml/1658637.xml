    <AbstractNarration>This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will engage undergraduate students in a summer international research program at the Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 in France. Each summer, five undergraduate students will participate in an eight week research experience. By recruiting extensively at historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, and predominantly undergraduate institutions, this project will attract students from underrepresented backgrounds as well as students at colleges without extensive research opportunities. The project will serve to enhance diversity among US STEM professionals, enhance international awareness and collaboration skills, provide important research training and provide participants with a broad perspective of scientific research in a global context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Catalysis and photocatalysis are key for the preparation of materials and the treatment of waste streams. New developments in catalysis is needed to maintain cost effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable cycles for chemical goods and other materials used in everyday products, medicines, and electronic devices. The Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL) is a well established European center for research on catalysis and photocatalysis. U.S. undergraduate students will conduct research on photocatalytic degradation of organic micro-pollutants, novel nanoporous hydrophobic materials for volatile organic carbon treatment, supported perovskites for air pollutant abatement, textile photocatalysts for pesticide degradation, photocatalysts for conversion of waste to value added products, synthesis of oligosacchaarides with solvent droplet catalysis, giant vesicles for synthesis of peptide and RNA catalysts, and analytical methods for monitoring photocatalytic conversions. These research experiences will train the students in important experimental methods that will uncover mechanisms of catalysis and photocatalysis as well as parameters that control the processes. Participants will engage in structured enrichment activities that will broaden their science skills as well as improve their cultural knowledge. In particular, they will take advantage of advanced training as part of the annual International School of Catalysis at UCBL. Consequently, participants will be prepared for careers in these fields and be poised to become future experts in broadly applicable catalysis and photocatalysis methods.</AbstractNarration>

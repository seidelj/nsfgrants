    <AbstractNarration>The United States is the world leader in the design and fabrication of medical devices, holding one-third of global market share. Aging populations and global military conflicts alone create a rapidly growing need for the state-of-the-art production of medical devices. There is a significant gap between the market for prosthetic devices and the nation's capacity to meet production needs in the future unless engineering technology and engineering programs educate future technologists to work in this field. In partnership with leading producers and medical professionals in this field, the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design Technology at New York City College of Technology (City Tech) has designed an associate degree program that is well aligned with the Medical Device Harmonization Initiative created by the current Administration and the US Department of Labor, to help the medical industry address its workforce supply deficiencies. Considering that City Tech is the second most diverse institution of higher education among regional universities in the northeast producing a high number of associate degree recipients, it is anticipated that this project will also have a significant impact on the production of a diverse cohort of technologists with expertise in this critical field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;City Tech will provide students with unique classroom experiences that combine curriculum enhancement with intensive hands on experience using state of the art design and manufacturing technologies and offering advanced certificates in key technical areas. Students will gain real world experience with the field through association by working on real-world projects with the prestigious Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, SUNY-Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, and other not-for-profit organizations, to design and fabricate prosthetic and medical devices. Students will be expanding their knowledge and multidisciplinary expertise in dental prostheses, business management, mechatronics, ethical issues in medical devices, and product lifecycle management through interaction with top experts in these fields. The project will also be introduced to grades 7-12 students and teachers in order to provide them with early exposure to this field.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Succinct non-interactive proofs are a powerful cryptographic building block with many promising applications in secure cloud outsourcing and in domains such as Internet of Things, medical, and financial applications where computation over privacy sensitive data is desired. Existing implementations of succinct proofs all rely on a trusted setup phase, commonly known as preprocessing. This preprocessing phase can be problematic since the system loses all security guarantees if the secret trapdoor generated during preprocessing is compromised. To make matters worse, the preprocessing is often not a one-time operation, and must be repeated for each application or, even worse, for different input sizes of the very same application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project investigates ways to circumvent this major drawback by exploring succinct proof systems without trusted setup. This project creates a programming framework and compiler toolchain called Lunaria which compiles general programs, written in high-level languages, into succinct zero-knowledge proofs without trusted setup. Lunaria aims to combine algebraic-, compiler-, and implementation-level improvements in non-trivial ways, and enable orders of magnitude speedup over a straightforward implementation of state-of-the-art theoretical results. Expected impacts include new, open-source frameworks for succinct proofs without trusted setup, thus giving research and industry access to the power of succinct proofs.</AbstractNarration>

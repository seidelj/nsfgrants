    <AbstractNarration>This award provides financial support for travel expenses for a group of US researchers to present papers and participate in mentoring activities at the 24th International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM) on August 21-26, 2016 in Montreal, Canada. This travel support would increase the visibility of the US delegation at this conference, as well build long-term professional networks for the supported early career researchers to enable and encourage them to be active in the IUTAM and ICTAM throughout their career. The travel award will target early career researchers from US, with a significant number selected from underrepresented groups. The early career researchers will be exposed to the latest developments in theoretical and applied mechanics, interact with many of the leaders and pioneers in the field, and to establish professional relationships with their peers. In the long term, such visibility and mentoring will help ensure the presence of leading US researchers in the international theoretical and applied mechanics community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ICTAM is the leading international Congress for world mechanicians and is organized under the auspices of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM). The International Congress is held every four years and includes plenary lectures, mini-symposia, pre-nominated sessions and poster sessions. The selected group of researchers will be paired with a member of the USNC/TAM or another senior US researcher who will assist the young researchers in identifying key activities and networking opportunities. A mentoring breakfast will also be held early in the Congress so mentors and mentees can interact.</AbstractNarration>

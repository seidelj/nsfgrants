    <AbstractNarration>This project investigates how to better bridge science and environmental policy by investigating boundary spanning processes, through which scientific information can be incorporated into policymaking. These processes are mainly conducted through organizations which bring together scientists and policymakers in a range of ways to enhance the integration of science and policy. This research systematically investigates the processes of boundary organizations and factors which may enable or constrain successful incorporation of science into environmental policy and will provide an understanding of how to effectively bridge science and policy. In a world where persistent environmental problems exist, this work will ultimately provide the necessary tools for a better understanding of the complexities associated with integrating science into environmental policy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides an in-depth look into the factors which support boundary organizations in incorporating science into environmental policy. During this in-depth research, ineffective boundary spanning processes will also likely be found. Therefore, to uncover both the factors which support and limit the incorporation of science into environmental policy, this study will closely examine three water policy case studies in the state of Georgia: (1) the 2008 Georgia Comprehensive Statewide Water Policy, (2) the 2012 Georgia Moratorium on Groundwater Withdrawals, and (3) policy debates related to stream buffers or riparian zones. Each of these case studies involved the participation of scientists, boundary organizations, and policymakers during creation and implementation of water policy. Individual and group interviews will be conducted to analyze whether and how science was integrated into each water policy and what boundary spanning processes affected the outcome. An analysis of media accounts and secondary documents will more fully explain the factors which may have influenced whether and how science was integrated in each case study.</AbstractNarration>

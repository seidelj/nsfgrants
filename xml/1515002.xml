    <AbstractNarration>Light is an important stimulus that triggers gene expression in biological organisms. The light dependent gene expression needs to be coordinated in different parts of the plant for efficient light harvesting and plant development. In this project, investigators will investigate how the proteins that perceive light (photoreceptors) in plants control a number of light dependent growth and development responses that occur in different parts of individual plant cells. The investigators will use bioinformatic, genetic and molecular approaches to examine different mechanisms of light triggered control of gene expression. In addition to training undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, broader impacts of the research include contributing to the understanding of how plants use light-dependent photoreceptors to tune chloroplast function to changes in the external environment. Such understanding is a prerequisite to allowing targeted regulation of plant photosynthetic efficiency and tuning of productivity. The project also includes structured mentoring in hands-on research of undergraduates from groups underrepresented in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory that plant photoreceptors provide quantitative and qualitative control over distinct anterograde signaling networks from the nucleus to plastid to tune plastid protein-pigment content and plastid function to the external environment will be tested. The specific mechanisms by which phytochromes influence expression of nuclear-encoded sigma factors to match expression of nuclear and plastid genomes will be explored using bioinformatic analyses together with network modeling to build and test a signaling network responsible for phytochrome regulation of chloroplast development, tuning of photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis. Additionally, sigma factor-dependent effectors will be identified through transcriptomic and gene discovery approaches and characterized through plant phenotyping. In addition to the essential training of students and postdoctoral scholars, broader impacts of the research include investigating quantitative phytochrome-regulated processes to allow targeted regulation of phytochrome-mediated plant responses. A training component of the research is designed to develop the ability of undergraduate science majors and students from underrepresented groups, including women and underrepresented participants, to think analytically and critically through the participation in hands-on research. The project will include participation as a host lab for the Michigan State University Plant Genomics Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates, a program for visiting undergraduates from underrepresented groups and small and/or research-limited institutions.</AbstractNarration>

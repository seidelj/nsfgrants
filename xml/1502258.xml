    <AbstractNarration>There is a need for highly precise, real time, fine grained spatiotemporal sampling of the ocean environment, which forms the vast majority of the surface area of our planet, but yet is 90% unexplored. Current methods such as remote telemetry and sequential local sensing cannot satisfy current requirements, let alone future ones. The notion of an underwater network is relatively new due to the lack of maturity of underwater acoustic communications. And yet, networks are critical in order to achieve the monitoring goals noted above. The Ninth ACM International Conference on Underwater Networks &amp; Systems (WUWNet?14), to be held in Rome, Italy, is a leading conference showcasing research in this area, and features a rich technical program, including technical sessions, keynote speeches as well as poster and demo sessions. This award will promote student participation in WUWNet'14 by supporting their travel and registration costs to the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students (especially those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from attending research presentations that may be related to their research areas. The research community also benefits by training the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

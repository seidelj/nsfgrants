    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a passive floating membrane photobioreactor technology to fill the need for sustainable microalgae cultivation for biomass/biofuel while simultaneously removing nutrients from impaired waters such as wastewater. The ICARUS process (which stands for Isolated Cultivation of Algal Resources Utilizing Selectivity) is important because allows the simultaneous production of low-cost and sustainable algal-derived biofuel and bioproducts, while reducing environmental pollution from excess nutrient runoff and the associated costs of wastewater treatment. The project will result in a prototype system of ICARUS pods which are capable of cultivating and harvesting high-quality microalgae at a wastewater treatment facility. ICARUS has the following unique features: passivity, modularity, crop isolation and protection, and compatibility with existing infrastructure. These features provide the following advantages when compared to the leading competing algae cultivation and harvesting technologies in this market space: 1) ability to cultivate algae monocultures in a "dirty" environment like wastewater, while utilizing freely-available carbon, nutrients and water; 2) ability to grow multiple algal species separately but within the same feedstock tank; 3) enabling multiple simultaneous use of existing infrastructure at a wastewater treatment facility, thereby accelerating process intensification; 4) production of dense cultures which passively dewater, thereby greatly reducing the costs of harvesting and downstream processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) geometric considerations for scaling up reactor volume; 2) strategy for linking multiple pods into an interconnected ICARUS system; 3) process control for a linked system; 4) large-volume algal growth kinetics and productivity; 5) long-term membrane performance. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a post-doc, a PhD student, and two undergraduate students, will receive training on entrepreneurship, intellectual property and commercialization, digital 3D design, process scaling, algal biology, wastewater process design and modeling, and membrane science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages Florida wastewater utilities and algae companies to develop a sustainable commercial product (algae biomass for bioproducts/biofuel), while simultaneously reducing the costs of wastewater treatment and helping utilities meet their regulatory goals.</AbstractNarration>

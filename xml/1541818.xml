    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a workshop to facilitate the development of long-term, sustainable collaboration between US and Japan in the area of advanced structural and infrastructure materials. The workshop, entitled 'The US-Japan Materials Genome (MG) Workshop,' will promote the aims of the US Materials Genome Initiative, an initiative announced by President Obama in 2011, which aims to double the speed of discovery and deployment of new materials, at a fraction of the cost. The initiative has already had a wide impact on society and on the materials research community, spurring new collaborations and innovations resulting from integrated use of experimental and computational materials research approaches, and open access to materials data. This workshop will further these aims by establishing collaborations with materials researchers in Japan, to jointly address some of the key issues facing researchers who wish to manage, maintain, and share large amounts of materials data. Anticipated outcomes include the creation and implementation of a long term, sustainable, bilateral collaborative program, and a joint platform for materials informatics and databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Structural materials play a central role in national physical infrastructure development, and both the US and Japan have substantial efforts in developing structural materials for applications in maintaining, and improving their large-scale physical infrastructure. In addition, both nations have efforts to discover, design, and deploy advanced structural materials for dynamic applications such as the automotive, aerospace, and power generation industries. These are major undertakings that require a concerted, coordinated effort in all aspects, ranging from fundamental materials science research, to the acquisition, curation, and maintenance of high-quality data, and, ultimately, to manufacturing products that are energy efficient, environmentally sustainable, and durable. The goals of this and subsequent workshops is to bring together a diverse group of researchers from the US and Japan to discuss ways to use predictive theory and modeling, combined with machine learning, data mining, and rapid-acquisition of experimental data to produce highly efficient and low-cost manufactured products, and to accelerate materials design, discovery, and deployment through the open sharing of materials data.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>PI: Escobar, Isabel C.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1607899 &lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests $49,000 to partially defray conference costs for up to 30 graduate&lt;br/&gt;and post-doctoral students to participate in the Engineering Conferences International Meeting&lt;br/&gt;on Advanced Membrane Technology VII in September 2016. The meeting will have 13-14 technical&lt;br/&gt;sessions covering recent advances in membrane research, development and applications. Some &lt;br/&gt;examples include the nexus of nanotechnology, biotechnology and membrane separations, as well&lt;br/&gt;as wastewater reclamation, gas and liquid separations and purifications, and energy issues.&lt;br/&gt;A poster session is also an integral part of the meeting. Supported students will be asked&lt;br/&gt;to present at the poster session. The meeting will feature a number of internationally renowned&lt;br/&gt;and up and coming researchers. The anticipated attendance for the meeting is 100 membrane&lt;br/&gt;researchers from all parts of the world representing industry, government and academic facilities.&lt;br/&gt;Membrane technology is an important part of the separation technology. Topics were selected&lt;br/&gt;based on providing an update from the previous meeting, marking specific areas for special&lt;br/&gt;attention, and showcasing recent advancements related to water production, the environment&lt;br/&gt;and special needs. The conference will highlight the following four topics:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Environmental engineering through sessions that will highlight the use of membranes to&lt;br/&gt;remove emerging contaminants, such as endocrine disruptors and algal toxins (e.g. microcystin,&lt;br/&gt;as the issues facing Lake Erie and numerous world countries). Another session will have presentations&lt;br/&gt;on lowering membrane fouling.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Sustainability through two sessions that will discuss sustainable water treatment, such&lt;br/&gt;as water reclamation and recycling; and will discuss membranes for energy applications, such&lt;br/&gt;saline water gradient.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Advances in nanotechnology for membranes, which will highlight the use of metal nanoparticles,&lt;br/&gt;carbon nanotubes, graphene and other nanomaterials for the improvement of membrane operation.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Scalable nanomanufacturing of membranes, which will highlight the mechanisms that can&lt;br/&gt;lead to failure during the scale up of nanocomposite membranes.&lt;br/&gt;Given the scope of this meeting, its more intimate meeting structure and diverse internationally&lt;br/&gt;renowned attendees, the ECI Advanced Membrane Technology VII Conference provides an exceptional&lt;br/&gt;intellectual training opportunity for graduate students and young faculty.&lt;br/&gt;The potential to improve advanced membrane technology rests on our continuing ability to harness&lt;br/&gt;results from basic science and engineering, of the kind supported by</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Scientific advance unleashes the forces of creative destruction through innovation, which has significant economic implications for industries, workers and places. Yet in the modern globally networked economy, local innovation systems alone are not sufficient to sustain economic vitality. The best ideas and resources may reside in distant locales. This conference explores knowledge connectivity -- collaborative R&amp;D across geographic, organizational, and technological space -- as a global division of labor. This conference brings together scholars from international business, economic geography, and innovation studies to consider the co-evolution of firms and locations and to define a research agenda to better inform policy in a changing global system of innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will encourage cross- and inter-disciplinary dialog with the view of building a holistic view of the spatial organization of economic activity. Over a two-day period (Nov. 13-14th, 2015), Temple University will host scholars from all over the world, with keynote addresses, paper presentations, and workshops. A call for submissions will invite papers for all relevant disciplines, favoring integrative approaches and novel data. Combining prominent disciplinary scholars with leading edge integrative work will give legitimacy and direction to this nascent area of study.</AbstractNarration>

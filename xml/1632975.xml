    <AbstractNarration>1632975 &lt;br/&gt;Seager, Thomas P.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST) will cover a spectrum of issues for assessing and managing products and services across their life cycle, as well as the design, management, and policy implications of sustainably engineered systems and technologies. The conference will have significant participation from students and young faculty members. The requested funds will help to expand the participation of students, underrepresented groups, and junior faculty from across the United States. Among others, three particular sessions planned for this year are (1) resilient infrastructure systems, (2) diverse photovoltaic stakeholder inputs and advancing life cycle analysis methods, and (3) approaches that bring together diverse groups and encourage high levels of participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ISSST paradigm is that solutions to complex sustainability issues are achieved via trans-disciplinary approaches. At ISSST, cross-pollination of ideas among natural scientists, engineers, social scientists, industry representatives, and policy makers facilitates the development of a holistic understanding of sustainability applicable to engineered systems. All sessions will be live broadcasted on the ISSST Youtube channel, and authors will have open access to the publications on the digital journal, Figshare. Authors' research will be licensed, assigned a DOI, and indexed by Google Scholar and the Library of Congress.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical&lt;br/&gt;Though black phosphorus was discovered in 1914, understanding of its semiconducting properties in the limit of a few atomic layers are at a nascent state with very few experimental results. There exists no significant application of this atomically-thin nanomaterial to benefit society to date. This research effort will comprehensively investigate the effect of mechanical forces via strain as degrees of freedom for probing several phenomena experimentally including changes in its crystal structure, absorption and emission of light, and transition from a semiconducting to a metallic behavior, all of which, can be utilized to enable novel optoelectronic devices and chips. In light of the recent progress on growing crystals of black phosphorus, this research effort on the strong coupling of mechanical forces on its unique electrical and optical properties can result in breakthrough device applications at practical scales. In addition, graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds will be trained in conducting research at the frontier of nanomaterials and electronics.&lt;br/&gt;Technical:&lt;br/&gt;Phosphorene is poised to be the most attractive two-dimensional material owing to its high charge mobilities approaching that of graphene, and its thickness tunable bandgap that can be as large as that of semiconducting transitional metal di-chalcogenides. In essence, phosphorene represents the much sought after high-mobility, tunable direct bandgap atomically layered crystal that is ideal for nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and flexible electronics. In addition, the unique puckered lattice affords in-plane anisotropy that is absent in graphene, leading to strong coupling of mechanical forces with electrons, photons, and phonons that can enable advanced straintronics for efficient nanoscale energy conversion devices and transformational flexible technology. The proposed effort will focus on the strong coupling of mechanical forces on engineering the unique electrical and optical properties of phosphorene that can result in breakthrough device applications. The research effort will consist of two experimental approaches, investigation of the effects of uniaxial strain on the optoelectronic properties, and studies on hydrostatic pressure in triggering structural and electronic phase transitions.</AbstractNarration>

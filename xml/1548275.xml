    <AbstractNarration>Biology is transitioning from a descriptive science to a predictive science, where rules for outcomes (phenotypes) given specific genomic starting points (genotypes) can be developed and tested. The biological challenge is to understand the instructions encoded in genomes and to predict the resulting phenotypes, i.e., the "genotype to phenotype" question. A nascent project named the Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG) with over 300 members has been developed at the grassroots level to initiate annotation of domesticated animal genomes and eventually the genomes of other species (www.faang.org) because these experimental systems offer great potential to address the genotype to phenotype question. This award partially supports a workshop to discuss the coordination of the FAANG initiative. This Gathering On FAANG (GO-FAANG) Workshop will have an emphasis on small and large group discussions designed to develop policies and practical approaches to maximize the probabilities of success of this crucial next phase in animal genomics. Participation of both academic and government scientists at various stages of their career will be encouraged by providing diverse opportunities for interaction in small and large group settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A slate of diverse speakers has been developed that will provide a glimpse into the incredible opportunities available in animal functional genomics as well as a perspective on integrating such vision with the status of the FAANG project. This approach will provide clarity as to the specific needs for success of FAANG. Community discussions will be focused on accomplishing the initial goals of FAANG, which include (a) establishing priorities for research efforts; (b) planning the management structures required for efficient use and sharing of samples, data and computational tools; and (c) identifying resources needed to accomplish these goals. Outcomes from the workshop will be published in peer-reviewed journals and posted for public dissemination on the FAANG www-site.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This project creates an NSF I-Corps Site in the Capital Region of Upstate NY at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RPI I-Corps Site includes participation from students and faculty from the Accelerate518 institutions: Siena College, Skidmore College, Albany Law School and Albany Medical College. Accelerate518 is a consortium of regional universities with the common goal of teaching experiential learning in entrepreneurship and innovation. RPI?s I-Corps Site takes advantage of existing Accelerate518 collaborations in the areas of co-curricular, curricular, competitions, and research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPI brings takes advantage of several resources in building their I-Corps Site. The Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship at RPI has a supports student and faculty teams in bringing highly technical solutions to the marketplace. Within RPI, the Center for Automated Technology has rapid prototyping capabilities. The Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies has resources for biotechnology and medicine innovators. And, the Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software is a leader for testing and developing software projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RPI's I-Corps Site enables increased formalization and acceleration of existing programs with a focus on supporting student teams directly. Student teams are funded with modest amounts for software for collaboration and instruction, infrastructure, transportation and building an MVP to enable teams to transition into commercialization or an I-Corps national Team applicant. The mentors, expert advice, and networking opportunities are provided by the Accelerate518 schools for all teams. The I-Corps Site experience directly supports the development of formal, active, local innovation ecosystems for faculty and staff that contribute to broader national innovation ecosystem, increasing the interest in innovation and commercialization as well as increased numbers of educated students in the lean startup systems and processes of entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RPI region is experiencing growth in a number of high technology areas with Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties becoming centers for technology companies and knowledge workers. Further strengthening a culture supporting entrepreneurship in the region could have a meaningful economic impact and encourage both graduates and recently formed companies to stay in the region.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Ryan W. Webb has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at the University of Colorado - Boulder and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Dr. Webb will aim at better understanding the lateral flow of water within a snowpack. The investigator will study the formation and scales at which capillary and/or permeability barriers occur in snow, and the applicability of laboratory scale parameters as input for modeling. The investigation will provide fundamental insights into hydrological processes that occur during spring snowmelt in multiple environments. Data generated from this research will be made widely available through the hydrologic database CUAHSI HIS. In addition to research, the investigator will engage in education activities like mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in numerous research opportunities and co-teaching a hydrology course at the University of Colorado.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamic processes that occur during snowmelt create a complex environment where the lateral flow of water has been shown to be hydrologically significant, though difficult to model. To model this process accurately, representation of snowpack properties at appropriate scales is necessary. Thus, the research seeks to: 1) determine the variability in grain size and density between adjacent snowpack layers required to produce significant lateral flow at the hillslope scale, 2) determine the driving physical (topographic, land cover, etc.) and climatic conditions required to produce these barriers, 3) produce a two-dimensional numerical model capable of simulating layered porous media with temporally varying properties, and 4) determine how suitable laboratory scale investigations of snow properties are for applications at the hillslope scale. Data will be collected across elevation gradients in the Boulder Creek CZO and Niwot Ridge LTER using state of the science Global Positioning Systems and Ground Penetrating Radar methods for non-destructive measurements of liquid water content in snow, dye tracer experiments for larger scale flow path development investigations, laboratory experiments for isolation of the effect of slope, and inverse modeling for upscaling previously developed laboratory scale parameters.</AbstractNarration>

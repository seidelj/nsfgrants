    <AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for graduate students who will attend their first national meeting, young faculty who will give oral presentation, and those who belong to the underrepresented groups to attend a Workshop that will be held October 2-7, 2016 at the Hilton Orlando, Buena Vista Hotel in Orlando, Florida, The Workshop will allow to promote science by providing a forum for exchange of knowledge among scientists and engineers working in the field of III-nitride semiconductor materials and devices It will address a large variety of topics with emphasis on growth, devices, defects and new material and device concepts. The workshop will include 20 invited talks and poster sessions. There will be three short courses and a rump session has also been planned. The courses will be on X-ray diffraction of GaN-related materials; Growth of GaN-on-Silicon applied to LED and HEMTs; and Simulation and modeling of GaN LEDs and HEMTs. The timing of this workshop is perfect for this generation of students to learn how the new science and technology of semiconductors is developing. It will help students and other young scientists to develop a multidisciplinary understanding of nitride semiconductor research.</AbstractNarration>

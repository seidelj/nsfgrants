    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation of US-based researchers in the conference "Dynamics, Geometry, and Number Theory," held at the Institut Henri Poincare in Paris from June 13 through June 17, 2016. The theory of dynamical systems is a major mathematical discipline closely intertwined with most of the main areas of mathematics. Originating in the work of Poincare, Birkhoff, and von Neumann in the beginning of the twentieth century, it continued to evolve throughout the century, branching out in many directions. In recent decades there have been many spectacular advances in the applications of dynamics to geometry and number theory. The goal of the conference is to bring together an excellent group of researchers from around the world to discuss new research results and explore new ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will cover recent progress and developments of the theory of dynamical systems and its geometric and number-theoretic applications. In recent years there have been spectacular advances in the area, highlighting various connections between dynamics, rigidity, Diophantine approximation, combinatorics, and many other areas of mathematics. The organizers will take the opportunity to encourage more young researchers and junior faculties to work on dynamical systems and related research topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more details, see the conference web page: www.math.u-psud.fr/~paulin/Margulis2016.html</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable American farmers to adapt to climate change by reducing&amp;#8232;the water footprint of major commercial crops. Drought is one of the most significant risks&amp;#8232;for farmers, rural economies, and the food supply chain; limited precipitation and irrigation&amp;#8232;acts as a major constraint on crop productivity. Climate change threatens to further exacerbate&amp;#8232;crop losses due to drought by shifting rainfall patterns and weather conditions across America?s most productive agricultural regions. In 2012, US corn production was 20% below the previous year due to a severe drought. Even in cases where drought related crop losses are not borne directly by farmers, the effects are felt by the US economy. The Federal Crop Insurance Program paid out a record $17.3 billion in insurance claims during 2012. While there have been promising advances in field management and in the development of drought tolerant crops, there is currently no crop protection product that enhances the robustness of field crops to periods of water-limitation stress. A product&amp;#8232;that could be applied to fields to reduce irrigation needs and boost yield would be first&amp;#8232;in class. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop chemistry for enhanced drought protection and yield enhancement in major field crops, with a focus on corn. Abiotic stress (drought, salinity, and heat stress, among others) is a major limitation on harvest&amp;#8232;yield, with few tools available for growers to enhance yields and minimize risk in the face of limited water. Asilomar Bio has discovered a synthetic compound that enhances crop tolerance to abiotic stress and enhances yield in field trials. The novel active ingredient is&amp;#8232;applied as a foliar spray or seed treatment to crops. The objectives of this proposal are&amp;#8232;the determination of structure-activity relationship of this novel class of compounds and benchmarking the dose-response behavior of a representative compound in the field. Successful completion of research objectives will result in enhanced understanding of stress protection and water use in corn as well as provide context for commercialization of this technology.</AbstractNarration>

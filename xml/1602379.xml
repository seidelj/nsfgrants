    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed exploratory project is to develop a dynamic mathematical decision support (DS) model for patient prioritization in the Emergency Department (ED). This model will integrate the use of wearable devices that collect patients' vital signs in real time and decision theory to account for patients' changes while they wait. The research will focus on the design and application of integrated systems for decision making by merging the mathematical models with the Emergency Severity (ESI) Index and wearable devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed exploratory project is to develop a dynamic mathematical decision support (DS) model for patient prioritization in the Emergency Department (ED). The coupling of technology and decision theory can help reduce the level of uncertainty that is inherent to the decision making process of triage nurses. The mathematical models will combine Multi-attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) with fuzzy logic and decision trees to predict patients' criticality and priority using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) as baseline. In addition, the MAUT model will be enhanced to incorporate attribute changes over time. Wearable devices will be used to collect patients' vital signs in real time; this information will be integrated into mathematical decision models to assist nurses in data gathering, analysis, sorting and presentation. Nurses will be presented with organized information regarding the status of the patients in a meaningful manner that would allow them to notice and respond to any significant changes in patients' status. This research will aid the triage process, especially in extremely busy emergency rooms where re-assessment is difficult if not impossible, putting patients at risk for undetected deterioration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Webpage:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.montana.edu/dclaudio/SCHEXP.html</AbstractNarration>

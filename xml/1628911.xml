<AbstractNarration>During a recession, although economic growth is falling, employers do not usually cut wages. A long-standing puzzle in economics is why paychecks usually do not adjust to the full extent of an economic crash. Surveys indicate that firms resist wage cuts because of a belief that workers will be less productive if their wages are cut. It is difficult to test if those beliefs are justified because we cannot observe the necessary counterfactual, without a controlled experiment. The results of this research effort will help us better understand how employment levels react to economic fluctuations and provide insight into a policy that governments use to boast employment.  The amount of money that goes into fighting deflation can hardly be overstated. It is important for economic progress to understand the effect of nominal wage reference points.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is a laboratory experiment to observe the decisions of firms and workers after a recession. Employers set wages in order to maximize their profits, given their beliefs about what motivates employees.  Employees then choose effort levels according to their wages and preferences.  The PIs will be able to observe how wages affect effort choices and measure precisely what firms believe. In this experiment, some participants will experience inflation. If a worker's paycheck stays the same under inflation, they are actually taking a real wage cut, however they may not feel as disaffected as they would after receiving a nominal wage cut. The results will contribute to our understanding of the impact of inflation on productivity of employed. Outside of a controlled experiment, it is difficult to introduce random variation in the price level.  The PIs can implement it through the exchange rate of performance earnings during the experiment to the dollar payments made to subjects after the experiment.</AbstractNarration>

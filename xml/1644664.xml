    <AbstractNarration>This project, from the City University of New York (CUNY) creates an I-Corps Site at this institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This particular Site plan is unusual in that it involves spreading the I-Corps program to the Community College (CC) population, as well as to other affiliated institutions. CUNY has a large CC component overall in its student population. Its approach to serving the CC population is creative and potentially adoptable and is likely to impact a large population. Not only will teams be recruited along traditional channels and through community colleges, eight CUNY campuses currently participate in a coordinated undergraduate research program, a source of additional undergraduate teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The institution (as well as its affiliates) are extremely diverse. For example, 60% of the student population is female. A large portion is economically challenged. Other typically underrepresented cohorts in STEM (Hispanics, racial minorities, etc.) also make up a large portion of the student population. Consequently, the expectation is that entrepreneurial culture changes are likely to be profound for this population. Overall, this Site could serve as a national model for inclusion.</AbstractNarration>

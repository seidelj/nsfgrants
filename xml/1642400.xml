<AbstractNarration>1642400 &lt;br/&gt;Huang, Yinlun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the 5th ICOSSE (International Congress on Sustainability Science and Engineering) is to exchange emerging ideas about ways and means of protecting the environment and its resources and ensuring sustainable industrial development. The congress will provide a common platform for researchers and practitioners of various physical and ecological sciences, engineering fields, economics, and social sciences from around the world, especially from the U.S. and Asian countries. The ICOSSE will be organized on the following key themes in sustainability: (1) sustainable technologies in processing industries, (2) sustainable manufacturing, (3) nanotechnology sustainability, (4) energy for sustainability, (5) environmental sustainability &amp; industrial ecology, and (6) sustainability education. Presentations are expected to focus on pursuing industrial sustainability from the systems perspective using scientific and engineering innovations. The conference should help bridge the gap between research and development, strengthen the linkage between academia and industries, and explore opportunities for broad international collaboration, especially with those in Asia. The conference will be held in Soochow, China, October 24-27, 2016. This grant is to assist in the travel support for U.S. faculty and their students to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ICOSSE will provide an excellent opportunity for U.S. academic attendees to exchange research and educational experiences with world-class leaders and other colleagues, especially those in Asia and near regions, and to identify international collaboration opportunities in strengthening sustainable engineering research and education. Junior faculty members, young researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, especially those minorities underrepresented in science and engineering, will be strongly encouraged to attend the conference. A student poster paper competition will provide an excellent opportunity for them to present their research activities and receive advice from leading experts from different countries. A publication based on the conference will be generated.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>What are the structural properties of closely related languages when separated for more than four centuries? What kinds of properties do these languages share and where do they diverge? Documenting and studying the intricacies, particularly in syntax ("sentence structure"), increases our understanding of the complex properties in a particular language as well as in closely related languages. While isolation caused by mountains or bodies of water has been one variable, this study asks these questions in an entirely different context by documenting the speech of a community that went into seclusion in the 16th century. With rapid change in the area in the linguistic and social landscape, there is urgency to document the language of this isolated area now, while there are still speakers. Investigating the grammar of such a language variety will show how it is both structurally similar to and different from related languages and contributes to the knowledge of relationships between languages in the same family tree. The project will train University of Iowa graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge technologies and methods for language documentation, digital file management, linguistic fieldwork and research methods in the language sciences. The collection and analysis of a publicly archived, wide variety of language materials will generate data of scholarly interest to other disciplines that depend on language-related material (anthropology, biology, history, geography), while increasing our scientific knowledge of the unique aspects of this language and its relatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;William Davies of the University of Iowa leads an international collaboration with researchers at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, teaming up to document the language of the Baduy Dalam 'Inner Baduy,' a small group of about 1170 living in a remote area on the island of Java in Indonesia. The team will record natural speech (narratives and conversations) and lexical items to produce an audio and video transcribed corpus of Baduy Dalam speech, a dictionary (with special focus on culturally distinctive concepts), and a grammar sketch. Recordings, data files, and field notes will be archived at the University of Iowa and the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures, where they will be accessible to other researchers and the general public. Broader impacts include producing print and video materials for direct use by the Baduy as linguistic and cultural education resources. Baduy Dalam is of linguistic importance in part due to how its syntax manifests the Austronesian 'voice' system, which involves how predicates (e.g. "subjects" and "objects") pattern in sentences based on the verb and sentence type. These results will contribute to understanding of the micro-syntactic variation in the Austronesian language family, the second largest language family in the world. The implications are thus important for typology, syntax, and linguistic studies of variation, especially the micro-variations in syntax, which have in many cases focused on larger world languages, like English, or Indo-European language subgroups, like Italian, Spanish and closely related Romance languages. This project will also support international research and training opportunities for a graduate student and it will stimulate new international collaborations between U.S. and Indonesian academic institutions. The NSF Office of International Science and Engineering is providing support for international activities associated with this project.</AbstractNarration>

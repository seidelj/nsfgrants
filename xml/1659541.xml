    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the REU site at Cleveland State University (CSU) is to involve sophomore and junior physics and engineering majors in meaningful interdisciplinary research projects within soft matter science/engineering. This will encourage students to pursue graduate studies in physics and engineering. Fundamental to CSU's REU site is intentional faculty mentoring, particularly, for underrepresented and minority students in physics and engineering. Soft matter is a group of materials that includes liquids, colloids, polymers, gels, and biological materials. Soft matter researchers combine physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering to study the unique properties and applications of these materials. Each participating student will work for 10 weeks directly with a faculty advisor in the nurturing and collaborative atmosphere of CSU's Department of Physics and Department of Chemical &amp; Biomedical Engineering. CSU's focus on "engaged learning" has cultivated a strong culture of support for undergraduate research. REU students will benefit from this culture through one-on-one mentoring from experienced faculty and a variety of professional development opportunities. Students' scientific and professional development will be supported through: a) a weekly science seminar introducing students to the multifaceted nature of soft matter research and careers in research; b) a weekly student seminar with informal student updates and formal student presentations; c) a final poster presentation at the Northeast Ohio NSF-REU Undergraduate Research Conference; d) travel support for presentation at a regional/national conference after REU; e) development of a long-term relationship with a scientific mentor; and f) a multitude of REU social activities to help develop networks among REU students as well as with student researchers from CSU and other REUs in Northeast Ohio. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;The scientific focus of this REU is soft matter, a subfield of condensed matter that encompasses a large variety of materials, from liquids that can be used for transport and for directing assembly of other soft or hard materials, to polymers that can be used for electronic or mechanical applications, to biological materials which people study to better mimic nature's complexity and develop new pathways towards healing. Undergraduate researchers will work directly with faculty members from two departments to contribute significantly to meaningful scientific research projects. Several of the available research projects are collaborations among the nine faculty committed to the REU site. REU participants will conduct original research via specially designed student projects within three main foci: 1) Microgel and Hydrogel Nanoparticles: Designing environmentally sensitive nanoparticles for a variety of applications and fundamental studies of volume phase transitions; 2) Anisotropic Soft Matter Thin Films: Driving self-assembly of soft matter to develop thin films with unique properties tied to the shape anisotropy of the materials; and 3) Soft Matter Fluid Flow: Striving to better understand and to improve mixing in liquid soft matter systems and use liquid flow to test and understand biological phenomena. Students engaged in an authentic research experience at CSU's REU will contribute significantly to cutting edge soft matter research with potential applications ranging from drug delivery to organic solar cells. Student research experience will be supplemented with a series of scientific and professional development seminars, research presentation opportunities, and development of a scientific network via social activities.</AbstractNarration>

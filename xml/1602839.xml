<AbstractNarration>SES-1602839&lt;br/&gt;Carla Goar&lt;br/&gt;Bobbie Reidinger&lt;br/&gt;Kent State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research examines the impact of body weight in task-oriented groups by testing whether weight behaves as a status characteristic; specifically, whether it serves as a differentiating characteristic that becomes activated, organizes performance expectations, and impacts task behaviors.  Using a standard experimental setting, the impact of weight on social processes is measured through an examination of influence.  In these experiments, differently weighted participants will work with their partner, dependent on the experimental condition, to complete two tasks. After considering their partner?s responses, each participant will submit a final group report in addition to their individual answers.  How often a participant accepts or rejects their partner?s answers allows for a measure of influence. It is hypothesized that the weight of the partner will directly impact measures of influence regardless of the weight of the participant.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The emerging field of fat studies suggests that fatness has negative social implications within American society which transcend racial, gender, and class categories; however, weight has not been explored as a status characteristic in the sociological social psychological literature. An examination of weight as a diffuse status characteristic will expand the sociological social psychological literature, specifically expectation states and status characteristic theories, as well as the emerging field of fat studies.  Greater theoretical understanding will enhance research on weight-based discrimination and group interactions. As reliance on groups grows, increased understanding of characteristics which influence group interactions is necessary. Results from the proposed study may lead to the creation and implementation of social interventions to reduce weight-based discrimination within diverse groups.</AbstractNarration>

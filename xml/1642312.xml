<AbstractNarration>The "Mechbio Symposium: Finding the Pieces, Building the Puzzle; University of California, San Diego; August 4-5, 2016" will be a forum where theorists, computational scientists, and experimentalists from both the STEM disciplines and the Life Sciences can begin a conversation about integrating different disciplines and methodologies to advance the field of quantitative multiscale mechanobiology. In order to have a cross-sectional representation of these fields, at least 40-50 participants will attend. This number will allow the different disciplines to be well-represented, without being overwhelmingly large.  There are many annual societies with meetings on broad themes, but this meeting will focus on the theme of mechanics in biology across the different scales from cells to tissues to organs. In addition to platform talks and poster sessions, the meeting will also foster collaborative efforts and potential partnerships between mentors and mentees. Break out sessions throughout the meeting with small groups will be given the task of laying out a list of specific aims to answer the question "How would you put together a cell's/tissue/organ mechanome"?  By engaging an audience across different career levels, and by disseminating the conference program to a larger audience as a journal report, this symposium will enable us to highlight the importance of mechanics at the organ, tissue, and cellular level. The organizers will actively recruit speakers and participants at different career stages, gender, and underrepresented minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the Symposium on mechanobiology and fostering collaboration among the multiple disciplines is of direct interest to the goals of the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology program.</AbstractNarration>

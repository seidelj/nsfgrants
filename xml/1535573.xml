    <AbstractNarration>The ability of a wireless device to achieve simultaneous transmission and reception (STAR) over the same channel has generally been deemed impossible, until recently, where several researchers have demonstrated the possibility of full-duplex (FD) communications using a combination of self-interference suppression (SIS) techniques, in classical static-spectrum settings. In this project, the PIs will explore a completely different application scenario for SIS, in the context of opportunistic dynamic spectrum access (DSA) systems. The project is expected to have big impacts on opportunistic wireless systems, boosting their capacity and enabling them to support real-time traffic. This will ultimately lead to the proliferation of a new generation of FD-capable wireless devices. Proposed techniques can be applied in many contexts, including opportunistic super-WiFi access points (e.g., White-Fi systems, standardized by IEEE in its 802.11af standard), femto cells that utilize cellular bands on a secondary basis, military radios that operate in contested- or shared-spectrum environments, satellite radios with anti-jamming capabilities, etc. PIs will integrate their findings in relevant graduate courses. In addition to results dissemination and curriculum development, PIs will carry out a number of educational and outreach activities, including giving tutorials and invited sessions at conferences, guest-editing special issues on FD for DSA systems, etc. PIs will also collaborate with BWAC I/UCRC industry partners to demonstrate a sample of the proposed solutions on their spectrum-agile radio platforms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key outcomes of the proposed project might include: (1) novel integration of SIS techniques into opportunistic DSA systems; (ii) optimized mode-selection strategies that enable a pair of DSA devices to dynamically alternate between various communication modes, depending on observed channel occupancy profile, traffic conditions, and SIS capabilities; (iii) theoretical analysis and validation of key performance metrics for an FD-capable DSA link under energy- and signature-based sensing, considering various non-idealities; (iv) a channel access and information exchange protocol for a multi-channel FD-enabled DSA network with heterogeneous SIS levels; (v) a cooperative sensing mechanism for an FD-enabled DSA network with diverse sensing and SIS levels; and (vi) an adaptive spectrum handoff mechanism for an FD-capable opportunistic network.</AbstractNarration>

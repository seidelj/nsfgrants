    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry supports an international meeting as part of the Chemical Sciences and Society Symposia (CS3). The CS3 convenes eminent high-level researchers from the US, UK, Japan, China and Germany to explore frontier chemistry research on diverse topics. The CS3 meeting in Leipzig, Germany, September 14-18, 2015 will be on the topic "Chemistry and Water". Previous meetings have been developed multilaterally through discussions of the chemical societies in each participating country (American Chemical Society in the US). This series is intended to be of great value to the global chemistry enterprise and to the world at large as it attempts to foster work in trans-national teams, across scientific disciplines, and beyond institutional boundaries. The workshop proceedings are promoted and distributed to the global science and technology community and the general public through reports on the web. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this workshop will focus on chemistry and its application for clean water. Four subtopics are included 1) Health and the Environment: an assessment of water and its role in disease, environmental contamination and the role of sanitation. 2) Detection: exploring analytical techniques to detect and measure contaminants. 3) Treatment: evaluating techniques to treat contaminated water including new membrane technologies, point-of-use treatment, UV, and the use of nanomaterials. 4) Recovery of Materials from Water: Assessing the viability of recovering valuable materials from wastewater including phosphorus and nitrogen.</AbstractNarration>

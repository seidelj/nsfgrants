    <AbstractNarration>This award continues NSF support for the ASA's Federal Statistics Fellowship Program. The program will foster collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts to develop and advance methodological and social science research on issues for which Federal statistical agencies seek to provide information. The program provides academic scholars with the unique opportunity to have "hands on" access to federal agency data. These collaborations between academic and agency scientists will positively impact the quality of the data collected and disseminated by the participating agencies. The program will help to create a pipeline for the recruitment of statisticians and other research scientists to fill future government needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Federal Statistics Fellowship Program will facilitate collaborations among academic researchers and agency scientists at the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Through this program, academic researchers will be supported for up to one year to work with statisticians and social scientists in one of the three participating Federal statistical agencies. Research will be conducted at these agencies and will take advantage of the data available at the agencies as well as their computing facilities and staff expertise. The program will increase exposure of Federal agency scientists to outside expertise, thereby broadening their perspective regarding analytic uses of the data they produce. This activity is jointly supported by NSF and the three participating Federal statistical agencies.</AbstractNarration>

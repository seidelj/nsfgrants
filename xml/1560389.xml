    <AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), located in Edmond, Oklahoma, will support the training of eight students for eight weeks during the summers of 2016-2019. This award is supported by both the Division of Biological Infrastructure within the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering. Research will be in the Republic of Turkey at Middle East Technical University (Ankara) and Uluda√∞ University (Bursa). Students will be selected based upon criteria that includes an essay as to why participation in the project will be important to the student's career. The program focuses on the honey bee as a model organism to study pollination dynamics in variable environments, behavioral ecology and comparative psychology, and behavioral and physiological responses to stress. The program begins with a mini-course at UCO that includes Responsible Conduct in Research training. An excursion through northwestern Turkey will acclimate students to research methodology and the customs of the region before groups travel to the campuses at Ankara and Bursa. The program concludes at UCO with group presentations and reflection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that a total of 32 students, primarily from schools or backgrounds with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will not only engage directly in team-based, cutting-edge research but will also have the opportunity to present their results at a national scientific conference. The program's international setting, including experiences throughout the Republic of Turkey, provides an opportunity to learn from a geographic region of great historical significance to human civilization; students will develop enduring professional relationships with faculty and students at the host institutions. Research findings will address global issues, including the causes and effects of Colony Collapse Disorder. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths and be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

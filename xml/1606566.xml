    <AbstractNarration>Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation. Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high energy gamma-rays. This award supports scientists at the University of Maryland College Park in their leadership roles in the operation of the observatory and in the scientific analysis of the HAWC data. The PI serves as U.S. Spokesperson for HAWC and the Co-PI serves as HAWC Data Manager. They will continue developing analysis algorithms and simulation tools for the observatory, and pursue scientific research on transient gamma-ray sources and spatially extended Galactic sources. This award will allow the group to continue and expand their outreach efforts, which include outreach to the Hispanic-American community with bi-lingual products related to HAWC. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With its large instantaneous field of view and continuous operations HAWC surveys two-thirds of the sky every day. HAWC will perform a deep survey of the gamma-ray sky and detect a large sample of gamma-ray sources with measurements of flux, spectra and variability. HAWC's wide field and high sensitivity enable studies of extended sources and diffuse emission from the Galactic plane. The University of Maryland group will exploit HAWC's unique capabilities to study rare transients, search for high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts, and probe the spectra and morphology of extended sources. In addition they will continue their leadership roles in operating and improving the performance of the observatory.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This project supports a conference entitled ''Extremal Combinatorics at Illinois III'' (EXCILL III), to be hosted at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, from August 8th to 10th, 2016. This is third in a series of highly successful EXCILL conferences that have each time attracted over 100 participants from around the world. This conference will stimulate the development of the field, will enhance interdisciplinary interactions with areas of Computer Science, and will help many graduate students and recent Ph.D.s improve and enhance their research. The proposed scientific activities include invited addresses by leading experts in the field from all over the world, a poster session for young researchers, and open time for discussions between participants. These activities in addition to enhancing the advancement of knowledge within the field, will also foster international collaborations between U.S.-based participants and their international counterparts. The conference activities will be disseminated at the website:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; http://mypages.iit.edu/~excill3 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is the study of existence, enumeration, and optimization of discrete configurations. Driven by applications in computer science, coding theory, operations research, biology, and other natural and social sciences, combinatorics has evolved in recent decades into a branch of mathematics employing powerful and sophisticated tools with roots in other branches of mathematics such as analysis, algebra, probability, number theory, geometry, and topology. The applications of discrete structures in computer science, engineering, and the natural and social sciences have naturally given rise to many fundamental combinatorial problems whose study has spurred the development of interdisciplinary collaborations across all mathematical sciences, both theoretical and applied. This conference will help bring together these ideas, tools, and problems from across mathematical sciences, building connections across fields.</AbstractNarration>

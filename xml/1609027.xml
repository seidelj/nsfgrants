    <AbstractNarration>Arctic and subarctic peatlands are highly sensitive ecosystems that are experiencing rapid changes in plant cover, permafrost thaw, and water saturation due to increasing annual temperatures. These changes are expected to increase organic matter decomposition and release greenhouse gases. Plant growth may sequester carbon in terrestrial ecosystems via photosynthesis and mitigate releases to the atmosphere over short time-scales, but the ability of increased plant growth to offset soil carbon losses is complicated by soil nutrient availability. In particular, the critical nutrient phosphorus may become increasingly limiting to plant growth as demand exceeds current supply; however, non-biological controls on phosphorus bioavailability remain a major knowledge gap for northern peatlands. This research will investigate geochemical controls on phosphorus bioavailability in high-latitude soils to evaluate the potential for tundra and boreal ecosystems to act as future sinks for atmospheric greenhouse gasses. The project will provide graduate and undergraduate students with research training in a sensitive and dynamic ecosystem. The investigators and their students will also engage in community outreach by running an educational program on soils at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. They will use hands-on activities to teach K-6 students and their families about Arctic soils, soil diversity, and the importance of soil as a natural resource.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the PIs will explore the hypothesis that phosphorus limitation at high-latitudes will be exacerbated by phosphorus adsorption to poorly-crystalline iron oxyhydroxides that rapidly precipitate during widespread drainage of iron-rich peatlands under changing hydrologic regimes. Phosphorus availability to plants is strongly regulated by hydrologic conditions due to redox-dependent interactions with iron oxyhydroxide minerals. Increases in iron-bound phosphorus in drying soils may lead to phosphorus limitation that constrains plant growth and limits carbon storage in plant biomass. The objective of this research is to integrate geochemical analyses (e.g., coupled iron and phosphorus extractions) with synchrotron-source spectroscopy to evaluate geochemical associations between iron and phosphorus across an experimentally-manipulated gradient of flooded to well-drained soils at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX). Additional geochemical analysis of soils obtained from long-term observatories in tundra (e.g., Toolik Lake, Barrow Environmental Observatory) and boreal peatlands (e.g., Marcell Experimental Forest) will provide broader context for this study.</AbstractNarration>

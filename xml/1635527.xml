    <AbstractNarration>Oceanic biological-ecosystem variability reflects dynamic physical processes in the ocean. This research aims to use newly-developed, state-of-the-art analyses of the chemical composition of deep-sea corals to examine how biogeochemical changes and shifts in plankton populations are related to environmental changes over the past few centuries. The project focuses on the Northeast Pacific Arc, which includes the Gulf of Alaska and the California Current System (CCS). Here instrumental records of sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, and coastal surface temperature reveal a consistent pattern of multi-decadal-scale changes in the North Pacific Basin. Funding supports training of one graduate student, one postdoctoral fellow, and offers research experiences for UCSC undergraduates, community college students, and high school students. The research team has partnered with the UCSC Seymour Marine Discovery Center to establish a new permanent exhibit highlighting deep-sea corals and climate-related ecosystem change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of this research is to couple high resolution records of past environments derived from deep-sea proteinaceous corals together with new compound-specific amino acid isotope (CSI-AA) measurements to create reconstructions of both biogeochemical change (e.g., source of nitrogen) and basic plankton ecosystem shifts crossing the Northeast Pacific Arc. Using sediment trap and live-collected samples, the research team will develop a more intimate understanding of, and establish explicit links between export production and the CSI-AA baseline values and patterns recorded in proteinaceous deep-sea corals. They will apply this knowledge to provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms of North East Pacific ecosystem change over the last 300-500 years. Overarching questions guiding this research are: 1) Are there structural, secular, long-term changes in NE Pacific Arc food webs beyond the Pacific Decadal Oscillation?, 2) If yes, how are these reflected in the community structure at the base of the food web?, and 3) How has community structure and sources of nitrate at the base of the food-web shifted in response to these changes?</AbstractNarration>

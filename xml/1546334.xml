    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of students, postdocs, early career researchers, and under-represented groups seeking to attend the three-day workshop on "Nonlocal Models in Mathematics, Computation, Science, and Engineering," to be held on October 26-28, 2015 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Nonlocal models are a type of mathematical model of relatively recent vintage that has proved to be very effective for modeling certain challenging physical phenomena, such as fracture in solid mechanics. The purpose of the workshop is to bring together experts from the mathematical, computational, scientific, and engineering communities who work with nonlocal models and provide a platform for the exchange of ideas. The workshop encourages the inclusion and participation of junior scientists and members of under-represented groups in STEM. This award will present them the opportunity to interact with and learn from leading researchers working with nonlocal models, along the way contributing towards the development of the next generation of researchers in nonlocal theories. Through the proposed activities, the award also facilitates increased partnership between the University of Tennessee and the government research laboratories ORNL and Sandia National Laboratories. More information can be found at http://nlmcse.usacm.org&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical focus of the workshop is on the emerging research area of nonlocal modeling, which has presented new challenges to mathematical and numerical analysis, and its computational implementation. Nonlocal theories have wide ranging application: heat and mass diffusion, nonlocal mechanics, pattern formation, image processing, self-organized dynamics, Levy flights, and jump processes, to list a few. Invited speakers and participants will bring expertise from a wide array of related fields, including mathematical and numerical analysis of nonlocal and fractional models, numerical methods and discretization schemes, multiscale modeling and adaptivity in nonlocal models, software implementation in nonlocal models, peridynamics models for material failure and damage, nonlocal heat transfer and mass diffusion, anomalous transport in nature, and other engineering and scientific applications in which nonlocal modeling is useful.</AbstractNarration>

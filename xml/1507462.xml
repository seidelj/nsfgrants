    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Marie-Christine Daniel of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County is developing and studying highly multifunctional systems, where specific molecular species are attached to gold nanoparticles. This work is unique in that up to five different types of molecular species, each with its own function, can be attached with controllable composition. These functions include the ability to be imaged, bind to a particular biomolecular species (like a specific cell type), and release a chemical. A system that simultaneously displays complementary and cooperative properties can be much more effective than a mixture of single functional species. The study aims to understand whether the property of a particular function is affected by the proportion of that function in the nanosystem and/or by the other function(s) present in the nanosystem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to study how the coexistence of diverse functionalities onto a single nanocarrier can impact their individual properties on the entire nanocarrier. The novelty of the proposed multifunctional nanoplatform resides in the use of a set of specifically functionalized poly(propyleneimine) dendrons to decorate a gold nanoparticle core in a convergent construction approach. The dendritic structure affords a common interface between the core and the diverse functionalities, and a higher payload. The convergent assembly facilitates a better control over the composition of the resulting multifunctional nanocarriers: this is used to systematically vary the composition/proportion of five functionalities (NIR tag, MRI tag, protein, and two different cleavable small molecule payloads) onto the nanocarrier and thus obtain information about possible interactions between functions and their impact on the nanocarrier properties. The broader impacts of this work include the development of versatile nanoplatforms possibly leading to advances in a variety of fields, in particular in cancer combination therapy. Also, in Prof. Daniel's laboratory, high school students and undergraduates from under-represented groups have the opportunity to participate to this interdisciplinary research and learn about chemical synthesis, material science, nanotechnology and biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>

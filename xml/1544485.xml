    <AbstractNarration>As commercial and government institutions adopt new technologies and regulatory instruments, the algorithms for auditing and accounting have become increasingly complex. This workshop project explores the ways in which these algorithms are being meaningfully transformed through human interaction with new technologies. The workshop provides a platform for scientific collaboration, the results of which will benefit those working to develop more effective auditing and accounting practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Hugh Gusterson of the George Washington University will organize a workshop to explore "roboprocesses", the highly scripted social algorithms that mediate Americans' relationships with commercial and government institutions. Bringing together fifteen anthropologists from a range of subdisciplinary approaches, the workshop would explore how different auditing and accounting practices become routinized and regimented through in a range of contexts: standardized public school testing, health care software, credit and financial evaluation, national security algorithms and homeland security, criminal sentencing and deportation protocols, the promulgation of statistical indices by international aid agencies, and the automated standardization of the American agricultural system. The project will advance scientific understandings of accounting, bureaucracy, and audit culture.</AbstractNarration>

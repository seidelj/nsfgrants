    <AbstractNarration>This RAPID award will enable researchers to determine the prevalence of the Zika virus and dengue virus co-infections in humans and mosquitos, household climatic factors affecting disease transmission, and which other species of mosquitos might transmit Zika. This project will fill in gaps to our knowledge about pathogen levels in the blood for a particular part of the human population, infection rates, co-infection between Zika and dengue in both humans and mosquitos, and what other mosquitos are able to transmit Zika. Building on an on-going study of mosquito-borne disease in Ecuador, the rapid deployment of this study will capture the spread of Zika through a naive population. The results will provide important information that can be used to control the spread of Zika in other locales, including the continental US. Results from this project will be relevant to the Zika public health emergency, and the researchers have set in place mechanisms to share quality-assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, including with public health and research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will assess the spatiotemporal distribution of Zika and dengue virus infections in humans and mosquitoes in Ecuador by collecting household-level data for the following: i) blood draws for infection monitoring, febrile episodes, and household surveillance where mosquitos are positive for Zika virus, ii) climate data, and iii) biweekly mosquito collections and dengue virus diagnostics expanded for Zika virus. This data, combined with mosquito control interventions by the government and individual households, and information on socio-ecological conditions will be incorporated into modeling of local Zika transmission and mosquito dynamics. This will allow for a framework to assess drivers and mosquito control at scales from households to the entire region. This project will identify and compare drivers for Zika and dengue viruses to reveal key factors in the spread of Zika virus.</AbstractNarration>

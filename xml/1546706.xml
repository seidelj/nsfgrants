    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the travel of US participants, in particular students and early career researchers, to the conference "Ordered Algebraic Structures and Related Topics" held at the Centre International de Rencontres Mathematiques (CIRM) in Luminy, France on October 12-16, 2015. The conference covers a broad range of topics in ordered algebraic structures, a dynamic area of mathematics in which there have been a number of important recent developments. The activity will contribute to the training of graduate students and junior researchers and promote the exchange of ideas among the world's leading experts in ordered algebraic structures. Eight internationally recognized experts have been chosen to give survey talks to promote interaction, facilitate participation and introduce junior researchers to the subject. It is of substantial intellectual advantage for US-based researchers to have the opportunity to participate in this workshop and to bring back to their campuses and communities the benefits of these interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will bring together major researchers in five general areas of interest: Ordered Groups, Real Algebra and Valuations, Model Theory of Ordered Structures and Algorithms in Semi-algebraic Geometry, Quadratic Forms and Abstract Spaces of Orderings, Real Algebraic and Analytic Geometry and O-minimality, Positive Polynomials and Optimization. In addition to the survey talks there will be ample opportunities for young researchers to present and discuss their work in both formal and informal settings.

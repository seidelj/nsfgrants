    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I Project will develop and validate a prototype of the first Electric Compact Utility Tractor (eFarmer) for sustainable and organic agriculture and other small-farm based markets. The eFarmer eliminates all fossil fuel related components (internal combustion engine, radiator, and exhaust) as well as all hydraulic cylinders, pumps, toxic oils and inefficient power take-off (PTO), significantly reducing overall system complexity while increasing reliability and ease of operation and servicing. This project will help to translate the most recent fundamental research into a commercially feasible and customer-desirable small farm electric tractor with long-term benefits including increased tractor performance efficiency, pollution elimination, renewable energy generation, long-term sustainability, portable power and new local employment and economic development in rural areas that are economically disadvantaged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;eFarmer is the first commercially designed small farm plug-in electric tractor and incorporates the latest in EV technology with high efficiency AC motor, programmable power controller, lithium battery and exchangeable battery packs for extended performance, all electric 3 point hitches in front, mid and rear positions, electric steering allowing remote guidance. Proprietary electric tractor transaxle and Cell Charge individual battery management system make the eFarmer a one-of-a-kind tractor. The objective for Phase I research and development efforts is to create eFarmer's prototype that is ready for Phase II commercialization efforts and mass production. More specifically, the project will focus on the following technological challenges: (1) creating new integrated electronics module with a significantly lower assembly time; (2) new charging and battery management system; and (3) new standards for performance, reliability and safety applicable to electric tractors.</AbstractNarration>

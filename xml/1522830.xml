    <AbstractNarration>Launched in 2006, the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) is a constellation of six polar-orbiting satellites in Low Earth Orbit. The primary payload of each satellite is a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) which receives positioning signals from the GPS transmitter satellites as they rise and set relative to the COSMIC satellite. The GPS signals are refracted by the atmosphere as they travel from the transmitter to the receiver, to an extent which depends on the temperature and water vapor content of the lower atmosphere and the density of electric charge in the ionosphere. The refraction causes a delay in the phase of the transmitted signal which can be inverted to retrieve profiles of electron density (in the ionosphere), dry atmospheric temperature, and water vapor (although water vapor requires additional information). Because the profiles are retrieved from the rising and setting, or occultation, of the GPS transmitters, the technology is referred to as GPS Radio Occultation (GPSRO), or more generally as GNSSRO, where GNSS is the Global Navigation Satellite System. GNSSRO has proven to be a highly effective observing method as the measurements can be made under all weather conditions, are unaffected by clouds and aerosols, and are absolutely calibrated (SI traceable) through the clock system that supports the GPS transmitters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds under this award support COSMIC-related work in four categories: 1) processing, serving, and archiving COSMIC data for use by the research community; 2) conducting research to improve GNSSRO inversion science and techniques; 3) conducting research in support of scientific applications of GNSSRO data; and 4) education and outreach activities to promote the use of GNSSRO data and its application to atmospheric research. Item 1 is the bread-and-butter activity of this award and its predecessors, and support is also provided here for improving the quality of the profiles and generating additional data products such as monthly mean climatologies for both lower- and upper-atmospheric variables. In addition to the COSMIC satellites, a small number of GNSSRO "missions of opportunity" are also supported. These are research satellites to which a GNSS receiver has been added as a secondary payload (GRACE-B for example). Activities under item 2 continue the PIs' leadership role in the development of new GNSS processing techniques, for example by developing methods to correct errors caused by diffraction in sporadic E layers in the ionosphere. Research under item 3 develops new assimilation techniques such as the use of 2D ray-tracing methods to account for horizontal refractivity gradients. Another task is to develop long-term climate-quality datasets in which profiles from different satellites are optimally combined to account for differences in their error characteristics. GNSSRO data are well-suited for generating long-term multi-mission datasets given their SI traceability. Work under item 4 addresses a gap between the availability of GPSRO data and its adoption by the research community. Activities include hosting academic visitors, conducting meetings and workshops, and holding summer colloquia and tutorials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has intellectual merit due to the great value of the COSMIC observations for weather, climate and ionospheric research. The work has scientific broader impacts through the PIs' education and outreach efforts to promote the adoption and use of the data by scientists from several research communities. In addition, the PIs provide the COSMIC data to operational weather forecasting centers worldwide, and the data has been shown to be quite useful for improving the skill of weather forecasts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supercedes AGS-1033112, the previous cooperative agreement under which NSF provided funds to COSMIC. While NSF is no longer providing funds via the earlier CA, that award will remain active as it contains funds from other agencies to support the development of the follow-on COSMIC-2 mission. This award does not provide funds for COSMIC-2.</AbstractNarration>

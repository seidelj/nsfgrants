    <AbstractNarration>This funding provides for a first renewal of a CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the University of California-San Diego (UCSD). The focus of the multidisciplinary site is on cyber-physical systems research motivated by real world challenges in exploration and scientific discovery. The site expands the successful UCSD Engineers for Exploration program to include students from other universities. The program aims to provide a unique experience for motivated students by providing an intimate mentored lab environment at UCSD, and a structured collaboration with scientists, explorers, and engineers at the UCSD partner organizations. These partner organizations include the National Geographic Society, Hubbs SeaWorld Research Institute, San Diego Zoo Global, NOAA, USDA, the California Wolf Center, and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. The program provides undergraduates with a unique opportunity to develop technology that will be deployed across the world; the projects involve scientific research that literally spans across every continent and into the far corners of the globe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is led by an outstanding team offering state-of-the art facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of real-world problems. The REU participants will be exposed to exciting research projects centered on exploration and scientific discovery while utilizing a vast array of engineering disciplines across a wide range of research topics. They will work with accomplished faculty and scientific mentors using state-of-the-art facilities to perform cutting-edge cyber-physical systems research. In addition, they will be exposed to extensive professional development activities through weekly research skills workshops and participation in an undergraduate research conference.</AbstractNarration>

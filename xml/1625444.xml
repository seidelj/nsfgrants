    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Saint Francis University's School of Sciences to acquire a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) system to measure gene expression and assess gene copy number. This shared instrument will support faculty and faculty-student collaborations among multidisciplinary fields including cell biology, environmental engineering, biochemistry, psychology, ecology, and developmental biology. Its overall impact is expected to be broad in environmental assessment and reclamation because of the numerous anticipated research projects that will make use of this instrument. Hands-on training with this well-established molecular tool will also enhance undergraduate biochemistry and molecular biology courses. Finally, the instrument will be widely utilized in high school summer outreach programs to further educate and excite young minds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the different disciplines involved, there will be a wide variety of projects supported by this award. An environmental engineering project focuses on determining better ways to alleviate abandoned mine drainage, a common pollutant in Pennsylvania?s watersheds. Two ecology-based projects, one seeking to create a better understanding of how diatoms are classified while the other will concentrate on understanding which proteins may be responsible for enhanced survival of dragonflies in cold temperatures. An animal development project will look at several genes to determine if they play a role in insect eye size. Three projects that will use mouse models or cell cultures have applications towards human injury and diseases. For example, a study applying stress to mice will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning susceptibility and resilience to chronic stress. A project exploring the signaling pathway of deer velvet antler extract, a substance commonly used by injured athletes, may lead to wider applications of the extract to treat injuries and organ regeneration. A study highlighting the transcription complex of mitochondrial genes will provide insight into how mitochondria initiate gene expression. This research is physiologically relevant to human diseases that have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition to the research benefits, these projects will enhance student learning within the School of Sciences and result in undergraduate presentations at local and national conferences, as well as student-authored publications.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for junior and under-represented researchers to participate in the Fifth Low Radioactivity Techniques (LRT) Workshop at the University of Washington's Husky Union Building (HUB) on March 18-20, 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop has a particular focus on early career scientists, graduate students and under-represented researchers. The workshop is important in the education of such young scientists not only because of the lectures they listen to, but also because they can directly communicate with the more experienced scientists who are the lecturers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LRT Workshop is focused on methods and techniques to enhance and extend radiometric measurement techniques and rare event searches that could be limited in sensitivity due to the presence of interfering background radioactivity that is ubiquitous and/or naturally occurring. The workshop science topics include dark matter, solar neutrinos, double-beta decay, and long half-life phenomena.</AbstractNarration>

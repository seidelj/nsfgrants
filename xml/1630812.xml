    <AbstractNarration>On September 23-24, 2016, the Department of Mathematics of Miami University at Oxford, Ohio, will hold its Forty-fourth Annual Mathematics Conference on the topic of Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems and their applications. An important feature of this conference is that in conjunction with it, on Friday, September 23, 2016, there will be a meeting devoted to research presentations by graduate and undergraduate students, celebrating the Ohio Delta Chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon (national mathematics student honor society). A new goal of this conference series is to introduce students to research in Applied Mathematics. The solicitation for contributed talks and the detailed information about the venue and the program will be posted at http://www.miamioh.edu/cas/academics/departments/mathematics/about/events/annual-mathematics-conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will expose attendees to a broad range of topics through invited plenary talks on Climate Modeling, Game Theory, Fluid Dynamics and Applications of Control Theory to Aerial Robotics. A series of parallel contributed talks will provide the participants with the opportunity to present their results. The main goals of the conference are to expose students to cutting-edge research in the area of Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems, foster collaborations between researchers in Tri-state area (Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana), and encourage involvement of underrepresented minorities in mathematical research on this topic.</AbstractNarration>

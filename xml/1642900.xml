    <AbstractNarration>The professional misconduct of harassment preferentially targets women, although men can also be victims of harassment. The realms of science and academia are not immune to this problem. Research confirms the extent of harassment in academic environments and in disciplines with low diversity, where the lack of established support networks can lead to feelings of vulnerability and professional insecurity. Another problem identified by research on harassment is the scarcity of well-defined resources for reporting and responding to inappropriate behavior, and the perceived risk that the victims' careers may be jeopardized if they speak out (Clancy et. al, 2014). These events have highlighted the need for support mechanisms for the targets of inappropriate behavior, as well as the need for a suitable institutional response to deter continued misconduct.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaders from scientific societies and universities will be brought together to discuss the issue of sexual harassment in the sciences, develop a statement of collective principles around expected ethical behavior, and suggest best practices for societies and academic institutions in addressing these issues. The approach proposed through this workshop will (1) establish firm and broadly supported expectations within the scientific community for ethical conduct and help identify consensus steps towards creating a harassment-free work culture; (2) provide a recommended common structure for responding when such issues are discovered, including suggested recourse and resources for both individuals and organizations; and (3) explore support needed for the targets of such inappropriate behavior when confronted with such situations, and the tools and training needed for the organizational managers who are responding.</AbstractNarration>

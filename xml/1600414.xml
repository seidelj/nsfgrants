    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Concluding Conference of the Special Program on Nonlinear Equations: Progress and Challenges in Nonlinear Equations" that will be held April 8-10, 2016, on the campus of Harvard University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (CMSA) at Harvard University will host a Special Program on Nonlinear Equations during the academic year 2015-2016. This program will include a large cohort of expert visitors from around the world in the areas of partial differential equations, including experts in general relativity, geometric analysis, and nonlinear equations. Harvard University will host a three-day capstone conference to conclude the activities of the Special Program. The conference will include both speakers who are participating in the program and outside speakers. The dates were chosen to reflect the highest concentration of visitors to the CMSA in order to provide a rich research environment for conference attendees. The goal of the conference is to facilitate collaboration among experts in various fields of analysis, with the goal of making progress on some of the most fundamental open problems in mathematics and physics. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

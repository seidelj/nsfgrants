    <AbstractNarration>In response to high workforce demands in the areas of computer science, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics, the project team for this "NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Program (S-STEM) Capacity Building" project at Fontbonne University will work closely with industry contacts to ensure that (1) Fontbonne's degree programs meet local needs in the St. Louis area as well as address national workforce needs and (2) low-income, academically talented students will be equipped to enter these careers by providing scholarships, academic, and career supports for its S-STEM Scholars. The project will concentrate on increasing enrollment, retention, graduation, and placement of diverse, low-income students in these focal areas. To foster this, the project will provide eleven scholarships, mentoring, skills for transitioning to college-level mathematics, undergraduate research and internship opportunities, real-world project-based learning, a summer orientation program, and a seminar series on information technology (IT) project management. In concert with this, strong industry connections will partner with the institution on the seminar series, internship opportunities, serving on advisory boards, and student mentoring to help promote and facilitate computer science, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics careers and/or entry into graduate school in these arenas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental goal of the project is to investigate the effects and challenges of a model for student success in experiential learning that includes: (a) engagement of industry in providing internships and developing real-world applications for project-based learning; (b) a summer orientation program to teach incoming students how to learn mathematics in subsequent courses; (c) seminars with industry input in project management; and (d) the implementation of faculty mentoring and cohort supports. Objectives include: enrolling eleven new S-STEM Scholars who are low-income, academically talented, and majoring in computer science, cybersecurity, or bioinformatics; graduating at least nine of the scholars in four years; and having all graduating scholars either employed in their field or attending graduate school within six months of graduation. To research and assess the impact of the various strategies, individually and cumulatively, the project team will use a qualitative and quantitative mixed-methods research and evaluation approach in connection with investigating a variety of variables including financial support, the orientation program and project management seminar, professional guidance and mentoring, and overall impact of industry influence and involvement. The research approach will allow the investigators to measure the success of their strategies, particularly concerning extensive and gauged interactions with industry. The research and evaluation will generate evidence that can be used to guide and inform sustained programming and transferability to other institutions, especially in urban areas.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), funded primarily by NSF, is at the forefront of the worldwide effort to directly detect gravitational waves for the first time and to use them to answer fundamental questions in physics and astronomy. The detection of LIGO's first gravitational wave will be a transformational event, opening new avenues for astrophysical exploration, opportunities to build more powerful detectors directed at known source populations and data analysis enhancements informed by direct detection. This award will support a workshop entitled "What's Next for LIGO?", which will explore the prospects for advancing the field over the next several years, informed by the data and findings that will be obtained. Participants in this workshop will discuss how the first few detections might influence which paths offer the best opportunities, and how the community can be prepared with appropriate plans, including international networks and outreach of gravitational wave science to the broad scientific community. A cohort of gravitational wave scientists, astronomers, and astrophysicists will participate in this discussion, with brief, visionary presentations followed by ample time for open discussion. Focus panels will summarize discussions and write up conclusions after the meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will be held in Silver Spring, Maryland on May 7-8, 2015. The workshop will have five sessions, one for each of the following topics: Multi-messenger astronomy, Data analysis, Advanced LIGO improvements, the international detector network and Gravitational Wave Science in the broader context of U.S. science. A tentative list of speakers and panelists has been prepared, and 6 of the 21 people on the tentative list are women. The organizing committee will give special consideration to women and members of minority groups, as well as early-career scientists.</AbstractNarration>

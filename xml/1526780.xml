    <AbstractNarration>The tremendous expansion of wireless communications has improved the quality of life, provided economical growth, and assisted the expansion of new businesses. At the same time, the new opportunities have created a huge demand for higher transmission data rates and a need for designing more efficient wireless communication networks. Understanding how to deal with timing mismatch and imperfect channel information in communication networks is essential for designing the wireless networks of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, interference management techniques have provided enormous improvements in reliability and bandwidth utilization. These improvements are achieved under ideal assumptions such as perfect channel knowledge and perfect synchronization. In this project, the PIs will revisit the availability of perfect channel information and more importantly the assumption of perfect synchronization in multi-user wireless networks. This project analyzes the effects of timing mismatch on the performance of multi-user wireless networks, from the viewpoint of sampling diversity, with the aim to explore its benefits in the presence of timing mismatch. This will lead to a theoretical derivation of optimal timing mismatch values and the corresponding optimal timing delays, followed by the practical design of communication systems that benefit from timing mismatch and approach the theoretical performance bounds, under a comprehensive set of channel models.</AbstractNarration>

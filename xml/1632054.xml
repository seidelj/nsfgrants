    <AbstractNarration>PI: Marchetti, M. Cristina &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1632054 &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Syracuse University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Conference: Summer School on Active Complex Matter (Cargese, France, July 12-23, 2016)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to support expenses related to the registration and travel of young scientists and students from the US to attend the summer school on "Active Complex Matter," to be held in Cargese (Corsica Island, France) in July, 2016. About 15 US participants (10 graduate students and 5 post-docs) are expected to be supported through this grant, who would not otherwise be able to attend. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active fluids are those where the presence of active particles that can self-assemble, or can move and pack in different ways, give different macroscopic properties to the fluid. The focus of the summer school will be on areas that are very research active, including microorganism swimming, collective cell behavior, and blood flow. The aims of the proposed workshop are to i) address challenges in the modeling of active (synthetic, biomimetic, and living) matter, ii) discuss approaches to overcome these challenges, and iii) to educate and inform young scientists (mainly graduate students), who will be attending not only lectures on techniques and fundamentals, but also seminars on current research topics given by internationally known experts in the field, from the US and from around the world. The conference has a strong interdisciplinary character involving researchers from different disciplines (physics, engineering, applied mathematics, biology) as well as different generations (expert senior scientists and students).</AbstractNarration>

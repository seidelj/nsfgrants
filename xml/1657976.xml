    <AbstractNarration>High-valued domain applications in areas such as medicine,&lt;br/&gt;biology, physics, engineering, and social phenomena demand&lt;br/&gt;both fast innovation and high execution speed and require&lt;br/&gt;productive development environments for domain experts who&lt;br/&gt;may not be computer science experts. This workshop brings together leading researchers in architecture,&lt;br/&gt;compilers and programming languages, and domain experts to discuss&lt;br/&gt;and debate potential approaches to accelerating progress in such&lt;br/&gt;high-valued domains with an emphasis on developing strategies for&lt;br/&gt;exploiting machine learning, including strategies for accelerating&lt;br/&gt;learning algorithms through parallelism. The goal is to stimulate&lt;br/&gt;an in-depth discussion of the potential benefits of joint architecture&lt;br/&gt;and compiler approaches. The workshop will promote broadening&lt;br/&gt;participation by including speakers from groups underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;in computing and early career researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will produce a report providing recommendations on:&lt;br/&gt;joint compiler/language and architecture approaches, compiler/language&lt;br/&gt;support enabling more aggressive hardware capabilities, architecture&lt;br/&gt;support enabling more effective compilers, and applications whose&lt;br/&gt;development process could benefit by these advances, The report&lt;br/&gt;will identify research opportunities in the interaction between&lt;br/&gt;developers, and architecture and language/compiler researchers to&lt;br/&gt;enable productive domain application development and highly efficient&lt;br/&gt;and scalable implementation on heterogeneous computing systems. The&lt;br/&gt;report will outline promising approaches and the research required for&lt;br/&gt;these approaches to become usable by the domain application developers.</AbstractNarration>

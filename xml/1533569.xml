    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Texas Southern University seeks to infuse innovative electrical and computer engineering specialized artificial intelligence (AI) tools into traditional engineering problem-solving routines with a problem-based learning approach to bridge current curricula gaps, enhance engineering students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills, expose them to new technology, prepare them for diverse and multidisciplinary workforce requirements, and attract and encourage students to pursue professional engineering licensure or post-graduate studies in engineering field. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are five key objectives: 1) to develop an interactive and comprehensive intelligent database to document, compare, and analyze cutting-edge AI applications in the civil engineering field and use it as the platform and educational media for curricula development and implementation; 2) to develop one new interdisciplinary course "AI Tools for Engineering Problem Solving" for senior engineering students; 3) to enrich current curricula by integrating innovative AI application case studies into twelve existing civil engineering junior and senior level courses; 4) to foster an interdisciplinary academic setting by hosting a server-based intelligent database; and 5) to support undergraduate students' early involvement in research. The project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to strengthen undergraduate education in their engineering and technology programs.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in a series of summer schools in computational number theory. The subjects for the upcoming summer schools, to be held at the University of North Carolina - Greensboro, are: May 16 to 20, 2016: Computational Algebraic Number Theory; May 2017: Computational Aspects of Hilbert's 12th Problem; May 2018: Geometry and Modular Forms. The aim of the one-week summer school is to complement the traditional training that graduate students receive by exposing them to a constructive and computational approach to many objects in number  theory. This furthers their knowledge and gives the students additional tools for their research.  Furthermore, the school provides the students the opportunity to work closely with experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The summer school is valuable to students for their careers as researchers and in their post-doctoral lives, since the event helps to create research communities. By meeting and working with other graduate students in their field, the students lay the foundation for future collaboration. In the years after the summer school, they will have opportunities to meet again at one of the regional conferences, including the Palmetto Number Theory Series and the South Eastern Meeting on Numbers. Additionally, by introducing the students to a computational approach to number theory, this project will enhance the next generation of mathematicians by increasing their ability to use computing technology in their research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information, see  http://www.uncg.edu/math/numbertheory/summerschool/</AbstractNarration>

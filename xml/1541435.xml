    <AbstractNarration>This project provides Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) a direct connection to the Midwest Regional Education Network (MREN) in Chicago, IL where Internet2 and other research networks peer. The project includes purchases of routing equipment and PerfSONAR servers to measure the connection speeds to remote locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This new connection offers a 10x speed increase to Internet2 from current connections that are shared with commodity Internet traffic, providing researchers, faculty, and students faster access to remote resources and collaborators. This benefits the ongoing research and teaching activities, which include: understanding ultra intense laser-cluster interactions in the X-ray regime, determining the effects of nanoparticle doping on liquid crystal systems, using the NSF funded BlueWaters facility for structure-function studies (using the hepatitis C virus as a model system) and also drug testing for alzhimer's disease, as well as the NIH (NIGMS) funded ANTON system to understand the detailed behavior of a nanobiomolecular switch. Informational sessions, faculty awareness, and use surveys will be performed to document increased use of off-campus computing resources and data transfer capabilities by additional faculty for research and teaching activities.</AbstractNarration>

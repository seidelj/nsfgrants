    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on using analytics and technology to benefit patients who require recovery care to get fully well after being discharged from the hospital. Transitions of care from acute (hospital) to post-acute (short-term rehabilitation and skilled nursing) settings impact millions of Americans every year. Seniors overindex on utilization of post-acute care, as a consequence of natural age-related degeneration and the need for longer recovery periods. By improving post-hospital coordination of care across the continuum, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction stand to improve for America?s aging population. If successful, this project will help reduce costs of care for healthcare providers, payers, and government/society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to incorporate and improve upon methods for user-centered data capture in healthcare. Our proposed platform will combine advanced machine learning techniques with a patient/family-centered business model. The innovation will harness multiple streams of healthcare data, such as electronic health records and claims data from both acute and post-acute care settings. If successful, this research will impact the state-of-the-art in healthcare analytics and outcomes measurement.</AbstractNarration>

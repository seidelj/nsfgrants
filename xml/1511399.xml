    <AbstractNarration>1512429 (Blaney) and 1511399 (Sengupta) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Waste streams have traditionally been considered as a source of pollutants to environmental systems. Poultry litter has been a topic of recent interest due to high nutrient loads in runoff from agricultural areas. Moving forward, a paradigm shift is needed to reconsider waste streams from a resource recovery perspective. The overall aim of this project is to investigate a hybrid technology that allows for continuous-flow treatment of poultry litter and high recovery of phosphorus. By shifting nutrient loading issues into potential resource/revenue streams, progress in reducing nutrient loads to sensitive ecosystems can be accelerated. This goal will be pursued through partnership with Triea Technologies, a company focused on agricultural sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hypothesis of this research is that phosphorus can be sustainably recovered from concentrated poultry litter slurries using a two-phase process. This process consists of a Phosphorus Extraction and Recovery System (PEARS), which allows for phosphorus release from poultry litter and subsequent precipitation as a high-value product, and a hybrid ion exchange, Hydrated Ferric Oxide - Polymeric Ligand Exchanger (HFO-PLE) unit that polishes PEARS effluent to ensure low-phosphorus effluent. The hypothesis will be tested through study of the following specific objectives: Objective 1: Optimize and model the process chemistry for PEARS to produce struvite and potassium struvite from poultry litter. Objective 2: Achieve additional phosphorus recovery from PEARS effluent using specialty polymeric ligand exchangers impregnated with hydrated ferric oxide. Objective 3: Determine the purity of the recovered phosphorus product and explore the sustainable reuse of extraction and regeneration solutions. Objective 4: Determine potential nutrient load reductions in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and development a start-up program for a PEARS-HFO-PLE pilot. The generation of high-value phosphorus-based fertilizers from poultry litter would be an important advancement in the environmental-agricultural field. The approach to coupling the PEARS and HFO-PLE systems will ensure process effluent has low phosphorus content. The project will leverage ongoing relationships with the Meyerhoff Scholars Programs, which primarily serves African American students, to engage and mentor undergraduate students in research. The research team will engage farmers and agricultural communities to describe the benefits of phosphorus recovery.</AbstractNarration>

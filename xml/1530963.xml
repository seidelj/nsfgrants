    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award supports the acquisition of a modern scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an array of detectors that image samples and collect quantitative data on chemical compositions and crystal orientations. This highly versatile instrument will support and advance research in geology, oceanography, chemistry and archaeology at Bowdoin College, a liberal arts college in Maine. Examples of some of the diverse research that will be advanced by the SEM relate to the movement of Earth?s tectonic plates, the evolution and eruptions of supervolcanoes, factors affecting clamshell strength, the origin of Arctic artefacts, and the metallurgy of ancient Greco-Roman coins. The new instrumentation also will facilitate undergraduate research training at the College. Undergraduate students will use the SEM in multiple courses as well as during independent-study and summer research projects. These research projects will train students to apply modern analytical techniques to original research questions in Earth Science and will enhance the infrastructure for research across disciplines at the College. Additionally, the PIs will incorporate SEM-based research into a pre-matriculation outreach program at the College that provides underrepresented undergraduate students with a multi-day immersion program in science. Images and data collected by undergraduates and researchers with the SEM will be used to increase public scientific literacy through an annual exhibition at Bowdoin College and through web page features. &lt;br/&gt;The SEM will be equipped with a backscattered electron (BSE) detector, cathodoluminescence (CL) detector, energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and a fully integrated electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) system. Using these detectors, the research activities will leverage the high spatial resolution of the SEM and the ability to simultaneously acquire multiple datasets (i.e. geochemistry and crystal orientation) to investigate a variety of mineralogic, petrologic, and tectonic questions. Example applications include: 1) characterization of accessory minerals that record pressure-temperature-time constraints, 2) crystal orientation measurements to infer the mechanics of plutonic-volcanic, deformation, and crystal growth processes, 3) determination of compositional zoning and/or domains in rock-forming minerals to track changes in pressure, temperature, deformation, and composition, 4) characterization of deformation microstructures, 5) measurement of the impact of freshwater flow on the carbonate chemistry of estuarine environments, 6) identification of growth bands in deep sea corals, 7) determination of the origin of artefacts in the Arctic, and 8) evaluation of metallurgy and the circulation routes of ancient coins. The instrumentation facilitates innovative research that meaningfully involves professors, collaborators, students, and community partners and expands the breadth of scientific inquiry possible at Bowdoin College.</AbstractNarration>

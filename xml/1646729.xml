    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) activity within the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the development of research capability at HBCUs that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. HBCU-RISE projects have a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department(s) and the institutional mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity as well as increasing the production of doctoral students in science and engineering. With support from the National Science Foundation, Alabama State University (ASU), a four-year liberal arts institution with over 89% African American students, aims to enhance the PhD program in Microbiology by expanding research resources in the area of nanobiomaterials and tissue engineering. This project has the potential to contribute significantly to the pool of minority students trained in the emerging field of nanobiomaterials and tissue engineering and significantly expand the breadth of the PhD Program in Microbiology. The proposed project will advance the mission of ASU by providing quality education to a large underrepresented minority population and increasing the number of minority students pursuing STEM degree programs and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research involves the development of novel 3D bioengineered skin and drug-eluting bone scaffolds that potentially could be used to treat diseased and damaged tissues. The project objectives are to: 1) expand research infrastructure by acquiring new equipment and recruiting high caliber scientists with expertise in the area of nanobiomaterials and tissue engineering; 2) provide research support to PhD students and research faculty; and 3) introduce new courses in nanobiomaterials and cell interaction, bioinstrumentation and tissue engineering. The established research infrastructure and partnerships with several research-intensive institutions will have a broader impact on ASU. This project will expand the scientific capabilities and accomplishments of ASU on issues related to NSF's mission, scientific achievement, and technological advancements.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Choices made between outcomes available at different points in the future&lt;br/&gt;(intertemporal choices) constitute an important and common set of decisions&lt;br/&gt;encountered in everyday life. How people respond to such choices is also known&lt;br/&gt;to be predictive of a number of important life outcomes, and can be summarized&lt;br/&gt;using laboratory measures of delay discounting. Understanding the cognitive&lt;br/&gt;brain processes that underlie delay discounting, and particularly our ability to&lt;br/&gt;resist immediate temptations, is an important area of research in cognitive&lt;br/&gt;neuroscience. Significant progress has been made in this area over the past&lt;br/&gt;decade. It is now well established that brain reward areas, including the&lt;br/&gt;ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), encode the subjective value of&lt;br/&gt;prospective rewards. It is also established that a network of regions in lateral&lt;br/&gt;prefrontal (lPFC), dorsomedial frontal (dmFC), and posterior parietal cortex (pPC)&lt;br/&gt;are engaged when making intertemporal choices. However, the role of this&lt;br/&gt;fronto-parietal cortical network (FPN) remains debated and less understood. The&lt;br/&gt;current research project builds on recent computational modeling work done by&lt;br/&gt;McClure and his colleagues to test and unify competing theories of FPN function&lt;br/&gt;in delay discounting. This work promises to further our understanding of the brain&lt;br/&gt;basis of important cognitive processes related to the exertion of willpower and&lt;br/&gt;self-control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will conduct three studies that employ both fMRI and EEG to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;role of different frontal and parietal regions in intertemporal decision-making. In&lt;br/&gt;preliminary work, we have used our computation model framework to&lt;br/&gt;demonstrate that (1) the pPC interacts with the vmPFC during the valuing of&lt;br/&gt;choice options, and (2) value information is accumulated in the dmFC during&lt;br/&gt;action selection. This project will further test how the FPN functions under&lt;br/&gt;conditions of temptation and cognitive load and how these manipulations&lt;br/&gt;influence choice outcomes. A number of disorders, including attention deficit&lt;br/&gt;hyperactivity disorder and drug addiction, have been directly associated with&lt;br/&gt;delay discounting. The proposed studies of delay discounting therefore represent&lt;br/&gt;a clear example in which cognitive neuroscience approaches promise to directly&lt;br/&gt;impact and improve our understanding of normal and aberrant behavior. Finally,&lt;br/&gt;decision neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary field that combines elements of&lt;br/&gt;economics, psychology, and neuroscience. It offers an exciting training&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for the students at various levels of training who will be directly&lt;br/&gt;involved in the project.</AbstractNarration>

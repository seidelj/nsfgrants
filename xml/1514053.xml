    <AbstractNarration>Automated knowledge base (KB) construction from natural language is of fundamental importance to (a) scientists (for example, there has been long-standing interest in building KBs of genes and proteins), (b) social scientists (for example, building social networks from textual data), and (c) national defense (where network analysis of criminals and terrorists have proven useful). The core of a knowledge base is its objects ("entities", such as proteins, people, organizations and locations) and its connections between these objects ("relations", such as one protein increasing production of another, or a person working for an organization). This project aims to greatly increase the accuracy with which entity-relations can be extracted from text, as well as increase the fidelity which many subtle distinctions among types of relations can be represented. The project's technical approach -- which we call "universal schema" -- is a markedly novel departure from traditional methods, based on representing all of the input relation expressions as positions in a common multi-dimensional space, with nearby relations having similar meanings. Broader impacts will include collaboration with industry on applications of economic importance, collaboration with academic non-computer-scientists on a multidisciplinary application, creating and publicly releasing new data sets for benchmark evaluation by ourselves and others (enabling scientific progress through improved performance comparisons), creating and publicly releasing an open-source implementation of our methods (enabling further scientific research, easy large-scale use, rapid commercialization and third-party enhancements). Education impacts include creating and teaching a new course on knowledge base construction for the sciences, organizing a research workshop on embeddings, extraction and knowledge representation, and training multiple undergraduates and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most previous research in relation extraction falls into one of two categories. In the first, one must define a pre-fixed schema of relation types (such as lives-in, employed-by and a handful of others), which limits expressivity and hides language ambiguities. Training machine learning models here either relies on labeled training data (which is scarce and expensive), or uses lightly-supervised self-training procedures (which are often brittle and wander farther from the truth with additional iterations). In the second category, one extracts into an "open" schema based on language strings themselves (lacking ability to generalize among them), or attempts to gain generalization with unsupervised clustering of these strings (suffering from clusters that fail to capture reliable synonyms, or even find the desired semantics at all). This project proposes research in relation extraction of "universal schema", where we learn a generalizing model of the union of all input schemas, including multiple available pre-structured KBs as well as all the observed natural language surface forms. The approach thus embraces the diversity and ambiguity of original language surface forms (not trying to force relations into pre-defined boxes), yet also successfully generalizes by learning non-symmetric implicature among explicit and implicit relations using new extensions to the probabilistic matrix factorization and vector embedding methods that were so successful in the NetFlix prize competition. Universal schema provide for a nearly limitless diversity of relation types (due to surface forms), and support convenient semi-supervised learning through integration with existing structured data (i.e., the relation types of existing databases). In preliminary experiments, the approach already surpassed by a wide margin the previous state-of-the-art relation extraction methods on a benchmark task. New proposed research includes new training processes, new representations that include multiple-senses for the same surface form as well as embeddings with variances, new methods of incorporating constraints, joint inference between entity- and relation-types, new models of non-binary and higher-order relations, and scalability through parallel distribution. The project web site (http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/projects/natural-language-relation-extraction-and-implicature-through-universal-schema-using-embeddings) will include information on the project and provide access to data sets, source code and documentation, teaching and workshop materials, and publications. In addition, datasets will be disseminated via UCI Machine Learning Repository (or other similar archive location for machine learning data) to facilitate sharing with other researchers and ensure long-term availability, and GitHub will be used to facilitate release, sharing, and archiving of code.</AbstractNarration>

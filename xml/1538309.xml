    <AbstractNarration>Cross laminated timber is a processed building material that is opening up new opportunities for wood in the construction industry. Made from lumber glued together in crosswise layers, the material is used in floor, roof, and wall assemblies in building construction. The product is an environmentally friendly alternative to steel and concrete. Its composite nature is forgiving of defects to an extent, making it a promising construction material of varied quality, small-diameter, and environmentally threatened wood species in Northeastern forests of the United States. This project pursues research that will develop basic understanding of the processing and properties of cross laminated timber panels made from low-value wood. Use of wood from forest provides significant environmental benefits because wood sequesters carbon, and creates less air and water pollution in production when compared to other building materials, in addition to being renewable and sustainable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research is to develop timber panels with natural defects and delineate its properties on a scientific basis. The project will pursue the following: 1) Develop probabilistic models for mechanical properties of cross laminated timber that has defects of knot, shake, and slope of grain; 2) Develop stochastic finite element model for the mechanical response of cross laminated timber panels; and 3) full-scale laboratory panel testing to validate finite element model. The project outreach will be pursued by inclusion of stakeholders of foresters, architects, and engineers in pursuing experimental tests. The students working on this research project will gain valuable experience in numerical and experimental methods.</AbstractNarration>

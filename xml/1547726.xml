    <AbstractNarration>The American Geophysical Union (AGU) and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) have teamed up to provide a series of workshops on topics that overlap and complement their respective memberships. This year, these professional organizations are jointly sponsoring a workshop on applying potential-field and electromagnetic methods to studies of sedimentary basins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There has been considerable student interest in attending this meeting; in fact 13 students have had their abstracts accepted for participation and the purpose of this award is to provide support for the travel and fieldtrip expenses of 12 of the student participants. These students will have the experience of presenting their research and interacting with leading researchers in potential-field studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference has been widely publicized via internet announcements and prominent webpages constructed by the American Geophysical Union and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, and the response has been excellent from a diverse audience. The expected audience is 70-100 participants.</AbstractNarration>

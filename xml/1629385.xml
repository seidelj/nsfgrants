    <AbstractNarration>This grant is to provide travel support for US-based faculty and students to attend The Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Chemical Product and Process Engineering, Nanjing, China, May 31-June 3, 2016. This international conference has a focus on chemical manufacturing technologies that promote both energy and environmental sustainability. The organizing committee, which consists of distinguished researchers with a broad range of skills in chemical process systems and reaction engineering, will provide for a vibrant and diverse atmosphere that fosters exchange of ideas on research and education. It is anticipated that approximately 25 US-based researchers will receive partial travel support to attend this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Depletion of nonrenewable energy resources, climate change, environmental pollution, and population growth are creating global challenges, whose solution heavily depends on the development of sustainable manufacturing technologies. The scientific theme of this Conference is "Sustainable Design of Materials, Process Innovations, and Energy-Water Sustainability". Meeting the world's demands for energy, food, water, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals in a sustainable manner while protecting the environment will be key topics of this conference. Despite its importance, sustainability science is still far from being exact, and there is a serious lack of sustainable engineering methodologies and tools that can be implemented by the chemical industry. The conference will provide a unique forum for researchers, scientists, and industrial practitioners from around world to assess the current status of research on sustainable manufacturing and discuss future directions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The US-based conference participants supported by this grant will have the opportunity to network with leading researchers from around the world and exchange ideas about the current status and future directions in research and education on sustainable manufacturing practices. They will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts and by debating controversial points with their peers. The meeting will also provide an opportunity for interaction and cooperation among industrial and academic researchers. The conference will address global challenges in the field of sustainable manufacturing with potentially significant benefits to society. The organizers plan to encourage faculty researchers as well as graduate/undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to participate and receive partial support from this grant. The conference will also include a workshop for catalyzing international collaborations on sustainable chemical engineering research and education. This will be especially beneficial to the young industrial and academic researchers, who will have an opportunity to interact with each other and with experienced researchers in the field from around the world, which could positively influence their professional development.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>An interactive scientific and educational workshop will be held at the active Volcan Santiaguito (Guatemala) in January of 2016. The meeting will bring together researchers, students, and observatory personnel to exchange state-of-the-art quantitative geophysical field techniques and to collect and distribute integrated volcano geophysical data products. The workshop will entail an initial (pre-workshop) deployment, ongoing field study during the workshop, lectures and presentations, and data analysis and open exchange. It is hoped that this workshop will be the first in a series of innovative workshops where a group of scientists target and study a select open-vent volcanic system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volcan Santiaguito is the ideal locale for the inaugural workshop owing to its diverse and continuing low level of activity (lava effusion, explosions, regular rockfall, and small pyroclastic density currents). The volcanic activity is amenable to a range of geophysical data collection, including seismic, infrasonic, geodetic, optical, thermal, and ground-based UV and microwave sensing. The scientific program will focus on volcano geophysics acquisition, processing, and analysis techniques through hands-on demonstration and focused discussion. Novel scientific insights are expected from integration of diverse data.</AbstractNarration>

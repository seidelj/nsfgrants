<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the properties of certain latex nanoparticles to learn which work best for separating different compounds.  Specifically, the research uses nanoparticles with a cationic shell to separate analytes found in explosives residues. Subtle differences between different polymers lead to noticeable changes in the separation performance, so it is imperative to characterize these polymers as much as possible to understand why. A better understanding of the polymers will lead to a greater understanding of what properties influence performance of electrokinetic chromatography (EKC), a microscale analytical technique used in separation of neutral compounds found in explosive residues. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Emily Hilder, a leading expert in the field of separation science, at the Future Industries Institute at the University of South Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Separations occur when compounds of interest interact differently with a material, and to get the best separations it is important to understand the material?s properties.  This project will investigate how the properties of polymeric latex nanoparticles affect their ability to separate neutral compounds when used as a pseudostationary phase in electrokinetic chromatography (EKC).  The research aims to advance three aims: 1) to investigate the latexes by capillary capillary electrophoresis in the critical condition, which makes one block in the diblock polymer ?chromatographically invisible?; 2) to investigate chain branching in the hydrophobic block by 13C NMR; and 3) to investigate the nanoparticle size and morphology by transmission electron microscopy. By better understanding the properties of different nanoparticles, they can be tailored to separate specific types of compounds, including environmental contaminants, pharmaceutical ingredients, or explosives residues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.</AbstractNarration>

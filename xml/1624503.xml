    <AbstractNarration>As a research site of the NSF I/UCRC for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR), the mission of the Rutgers Institute for Data Science, Learning, and Applications (I-DSLA) is to advance research and education in the area of Big data management and analytics. The multidisciplinary research program in collaboration with the industry partners, focuses on addressing research and development challenges in application domains that span healthcare; e-government and e-commerce; and community resilience and public safety. A key objective of this project is to integrate research and education by providing student opportunities to work on real world problems with industry partners. The emphasis on real problems is particularly suited to attracting individuals from diverse backgrounds, broadening participation in computer science and informatics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda of the Rutgers I-DSLA site is complementary and synergistic to that of CHMPR. The research projects at I-DSLA span several themes (data analytics, machine learning, data management, information security and privacy, social media, Web services, and semantic Web) and domains. In the healthcare domain, the multidisciplinary research program involves researchers from the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Cancer Center, Rutgers I-DSLA, and Rutgers Center for Information Management, Integration, and Connectivity (CIMIC). The program leverages the complementary expertise of the team members to develop data analytics-based approaches that enables discovery of optimal treatment regimens and identification of patient and disease characteristics that permit responses to specific therapeutic combinations and modalities. In the e-government and e-commerce domains, the research work addresses fundamental problems related to secure information sharing, business process composition and management, and privacy-preserving data analysis. In the community resilience and public safety domain, the research work focuses on disaster management, critical infrastructure protection, and smart cities.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Many animals leave their birth places as they become adults to avoid competing or mating with relatives. However, traveling to and settling in a new area can be dangerous as animals are exposed to new diseases, predators, and unfriendly neighbors. This project is to identify the qualities that help these animals along the way, and to test whether those that are better able to withstand disease and to cope with stress are more successful. The research team will use sophisticated GPS technology to monitor the health and survival of young female Meerkats in the Kalahari Desert as they move from one social group to another. The project will also train undergraduate students and engage schoolchildren in the research through popular media and the Friends of Kalahari website. In addition to advancing our knowledge of dispersal, the results of this study will inform the ways in which we manage animals in fragmented and changing habitats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In previous work on meerkat societies, the PIs found that dominant females, which are hormonally "masculinized", have the weakest constitutive immune responses of all group members, indicating a cost of androgen exposure in females. Moreover, because androgen concentrations vary with female social status, the PIs found evidence for organizational effects of differential prenatal androgen exposure on the health of juvenile offspring derived from dominant control (DC), subordinate control (SC), and dominant treated (DT) dams receiving an androgen-receptor blocker. Here, the PIs will follow the daughters of DC, SC, and DT dams over the next life-history stage "dispersal" to study the transgenerational effects of maternal social status/prenatal T on offspring dispersal. Using an integrated approach that combines behavioral, hormonal, and immunological analyses with novel global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data, the PIs will chart the health and social trajectories of daughters over successive stages of dispersal (during emigration from the natal group, a transience period, and settlement in a new territory). Specifically, the PIs will (1) determine dominance relationships and identify likely dispersers via regular behavioral observation; (2) fit GPS radio collars to 25 pre-dispersal females and chart their movements on an hourly basis; (3) measure immunocompetence (parasite burden and immune response) and hormone concentrations (androgens and glucocorticoids) in (a) fecal samples (collected prior to, over the course of, and following dispersal) and (b) serum samples (collected pre-dispersal and post-settlement); and (4) evaluate the health and survival of these females in their newly formed groups.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>1511784&lt;br/&gt;Jellison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cryptosporidium is a waterborne parasite responsible for a gastrointestinal disease that can be fatal for the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidiosis has no medical cure, and since oocysts may not be completely removed/inactivated in municipal water treatment plants, monitoring Cryptosporidium contamination in source waters is necessary to identify public health risks and determine where limited budgets should most effectively be spent to protect consumers from waterborne exposure to pathogenic oocysts. Current sample methodology for Cryptosporidium monitoring in water supplies (EPA Method 1623.1) relies on filtering and processing 10 L of water, providing a "snapshot" of river conditions at the time of filtration. The primary goal of the team is to develop a cheaper and more reliable method for detecting Cryptosporidium oocysts in public water supplies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work in the PIs laboratory has shown that Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts can robustly attach to biofilms; however, biofilm sampling is limited by the inherent variability in biofilm growth. Taking inspiration from this biofilm sorptive nature, the current team will focus on developing a manufactured substrate with fixed sorptive capacity for Cryptosporidium oocysts. These substrates will be engineered with surface features complementary to the oocyst that allow either non-specific adhesion through surface chemistry that would allow for hydrogen bonding or specific adhesion by imprinting a molecular fingerprint of the oocyst surface onto the substrate. These substrates will be analyzed initially in lab-scale bioreactors, which will provide crucial binding parameters. The substrates will then be deployed in natural waterways to determine the robustness of the substrates, with the goal of eventually providing a more temporal look at the health of the waterway. This research program is highly interdisciplinary, providing an excellent opportunity for student training through new courses and hands-on research opportunities. The PI and co-PI have a history of mentoring students from underrepresented groups in STEM, and will continue to recruit from these groups for inclusion in this project. In addition, several educational programs will be developed in collaboration with Broughal Middle School, a nearby Title 1 school. These educational programs will include brochures, projects, and field education focused on water safety and conservation.</AbstractNarration>

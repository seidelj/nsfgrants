    <AbstractNarration>The water-energy nexus, and the relationship to food production, is a growing national priority. Water use for energy production has increased dramatically in the last decade and is expected to increase. This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM), Water-Energy Education for the Next Generation (WE2NG), offers a unique and experiential program focused on the water-energy nexus for STEM teachers at one of the world's leading science and engineering schools with a long-standing and successful relationship with industry partners. WE2NG will be one of the first RET programs to advance the dialogue on the water-energy nexus through integration of teachers, and ultimately their students with cutting-edge water-energy research and technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over three years, the RET Site will target 30 K-12 STEM teachers and students from the Jefferson County School District for participation in an eight week intensive summer research program related to water and energy mentored by faculty and graduate students. The WE2NG program will: 1) Build science proficiency in the water-energy nexus in the regional K-12 system; 2) Enhance science lessons and curriculum that address state science standards; 3) Improve science literacy in the Colorado community through teachers and their students; 4) Promote interest in STEM careers in teacher-student groups through interactions with world class researchers at a top-tier science and engineering school; 5) Provide teacher connections to local industry for long-term partnerships; and 6) Develop long-term infrastructure for sustainable teacher-engineer-scientist interactions at CSM. The WE2NG RET Site program has extensive broader impacts, including explicit and sustainable professional development and the creation of educational materials in the water-energy nexus for Colorado school districts.</AbstractNarration>

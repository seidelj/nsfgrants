    <AbstractNarration>This research deals with the interactions between number theory and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory. Number theory is the study of the properties&lt;br/&gt;of the whole numbers, and is the oldest branch of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is the systematic study of symmetry, through the&lt;br/&gt;development of simple mathematical objects that encode the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;irreducible pieces of symmetry. A principal aim of the proposal is to&lt;br/&gt;explore relationships between these two subjects in the spirit of the&lt;br/&gt;"Langlands philosophy," which predicts deep connections between number&lt;br/&gt;theory and representation theory. Today the questions and phenomena&lt;br/&gt;addressed by these subjects serve as driving forces in much of&lt;br/&gt;contemporary mathematics research. Moreover, the individual areas&lt;br/&gt;themselves have contributed many applications in such diverse areas as&lt;br/&gt;coding and data transmission, chemistry, physics, and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems that will be investigated in this project focus on&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic groups and multiple Dirichlet series, objects that are&lt;br/&gt;intimately related to automorphic forms. The first part addresses&lt;br/&gt;topics related to cohomology of arithmetic groups and allied areas,&lt;br/&gt;such as the geometry of locally symmetric spaces and the conjectures&lt;br/&gt;linking cohomology to arithmetic geometry and Galois representations.&lt;br/&gt;A central goal of this part is the computational investigation of&lt;br/&gt;torsion in the cohomology of various arithmetic groups and its&lt;br/&gt;relation to arithmetic. The second part studies multiple Dirichlet&lt;br/&gt;series attached to Weyl groups. These are infinite series in several&lt;br/&gt;complex variables that satisfy a group of functional equations&lt;br/&gt;intermixing all the variables. The topics in this part emphasize&lt;br/&gt;connections between these series and combinatorics, representation&lt;br/&gt;theory, automorphic forms, and mathematical physics.</AbstractNarration>

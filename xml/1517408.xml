    <AbstractNarration>Epigenetics (the study of physiological variation not caused by DNA) is an expanding area of great importance to the survival and health of living organisms. This research will investigate the evolutionary origin of epigenetics using an archaeal microbe as the studied organism. The results of this project could establish new ways to understand fundamental aspects of epigenetics. The project will also provide training for college students through new classroom-based efforts including hands-on laboratory modules for general microbiology courses. The modules will be adapted for use in high schools and with underrepresented minority students in the U. S. Department of Education Upward Bound program. Graduate and undergraduate students will be cross-trained in multiple disciplines, including systems biology, genetics, biochemistry, and microbiology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A heritable phenotype results from transmission of a DNA allele or chromatin modification state that controls gene expression. The archaeon Sulfolobus solfatarics has chromatin proteins that are methylated and acetylated. Sophisticated chromatin-based mechanisms in eukaryotes are known to regulate gene expression, but the extent to which similar processes might be used in the archaeal kingdom is unknown. This project will test the hypothesis that archaeal chromatin protein modification and gene expression are coupled in a coordinated fashion. The anticipated results will provide a new context in which to place transcriptional regulation in the archaea and expand insight into the evolution of chromatin.</AbstractNarration>

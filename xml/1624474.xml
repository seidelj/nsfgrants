    <AbstractNarration>Nontechnical description&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will support student participation in the 2016 International Microwave Symposium (IMS) that will be held in San Francisco, California from May 22 to May 27, 2016. Support will be provided for an educational program called IMS Connect which was initiated in 2014 and will be expanded in this year's event. The proposed work will focus on exposing underrepresented students to exciting opportunities and potential mentors within the IMS community related to broad technology areas such as electronics and communications. The participating students will also be introduced to innovation and entrepreneurship efforts emerging in a variety of new technological areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;IMS will address research areas in RF/microwave engineering and is the largest conference in the world in this field. The project will provide awareness on career opportunities and expectations and access to role models and potential mentors. It will also be described in professional magazines with the potential to encourage other conferences to adopt a similar type of program.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The Scholars of Excellence in Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) program will be an interdisciplinary, multi-year, mixed academic-level program offering scholarships to engineering and computer science majors with academic talent and financial need. The goals of the scholarship program will be to: (1) increase the number of low-income, academically talented students in engineering and computer science majors, (2) assist students in continuing their STEM education through graduation, (3) foster professional development for STEM careers and graduate education, and (4) study the impact of targeted intervention strategies on retention of STEM majors. Students awarded SEECS scholarships will be required to attend a seminar with a team-based, project-based environment structure. The SEECS seminar will encompass three components: engineering design, professional development, and personal development. Facets of STEM majors' professional and personal development will be addressed through workshops, university support services, lectures, and invited speakers. While the professional and personal development facets will occur through typical seminar activities, such as guest speakers and reflective activities, the engineering design component will be the pivotal experience to connect and build engineering competency and personal confidence. Additionally, the design projects will benefit regional service organizations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEECS academic-research project will assess the effect of academic interventions on retention rates of high-performing students at the University. University-wide data will be analyzed to monitor the individual effects of intervention strategies. Peer-assisted study strategies (PASS) will be utilized as an intervention to address potential low academic performance. PASS uses peer-tutored extra help sessions for identified attrition point courses. SEECS will evaluate the success of PASS programs in reducing attrition. Project resources will be utilized to investigate the research question: Does peer-assisted study have a measurable positive effect on academic performance for nominally high-achieving students? Additionally, the project will continue to study and disseminate the effect of experiential education as expressed through community-service design projects. The expected outcomes of the proposed work include the dissemination of: (1) research study results, (2) program structure and successes to provide a model for implementation, and (3) student-generated STEM solutions to support local non-profit organizations.</AbstractNarration>

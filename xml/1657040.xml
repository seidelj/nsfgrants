    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop practical non-malleable codes, which are encoding schemes that have the property that modifying an encoded message results in either decoding the original message or a totally unrelated message. This will improve upon previous constructions and create practical methods to secure against memory attacks for both computers and portable devices. The practical designs developed in this project would immediately improve the performance in applications that use non-malleable codes. The project introduces new research-integrated courses regarding cryptographic coding and physical attacks, and defines appropriate research activities for training undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project conducts a comprehensive study of a new cryptographic primitive called l-more extractable hash. The investigators explore methods to derive practical coding schemes using this primitive, and instantiate this primitive efficiently under various computational assumptions. This research is expected to significantly advance the understanding on practical designs of non-malleable codes and their generalizations, and the new developments could potentially lead to many further practical designs against even broader classes of physical attacks.</AbstractNarration>

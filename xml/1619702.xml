<AbstractNarration>The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in their efforts to significantly increase the numbers of students matriculating into and successfully completing high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines in order to diversify the STEM workforce. The Bridge to the Baccalaureate (B2B) track in the LSAMP program provides support for alliances of community colleges (2-year institutions) to accelerate the transfer of students from racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines to four-year institutions. It is expected that B2B alliances provide a bridge to the baccalaureate degree for STEM students from underrepresented populations who begin their instruction at a community college. The University of Hawaii Community Colleges (UHCC's) have formed a strategic transfer alliance for Native Hawaiian and other underrepresented students in Hawaii. This LSAMP B2B Alliance, called the Strategic Transfer Alliance for Minority Participation (STAMP), led by the University of Hawaii Kapiolani Community College, will support and advance STEM education and increase transfer rates for these six community colleges and the University of Hawaii Maui College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The B2B STAMP will implement proven strategies and activities to increase the number of Native Hawaiian and other underrepresented students transferring annually into baccalaureate STEM degree programs by ~11% per year over the next 3 years (from 205 to 300). B2B STAMP will employ three strategies for success: 1) math acceleration for first and second year students, 2) peer mentoring, and 3) undergraduate research experiences (URE) for students as they mature academically in their sophomore year and transition to baccalaureate STEM degrees. The B2B STAMP retention and progression strategy of providing math acceleration, peer mentoring and undergraduate research experiences will strengthen the next generation of STEM Scholars who can compete in the STEM workforce while advancing science, technology, and sustainability goals and achievements for the people of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.</AbstractNarration>

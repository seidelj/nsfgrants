    <AbstractNarration>The elemental composition of natural waters, sediments, airborne dust, rainwater and marine microbiota contains information that is essential to an understanding the workings of Earth system, and its past and future trajectories, which are of fundamental importance to human society. Moreover, the ability to perform and interpret such chemical analyses is an essential part of the education and training of many scientific professionals within the field of ocean and earth sciences. Among the most commonly used methods for such elemental analyses is plasma source mass spectrometry, whereby a new generation of sample introduction systems coupled to a high-resolution inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) allows routine elemental determinations in a wide variety of natural materials, over large ranges in elemental concentrations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award will support the acquisition of a new, state-of-the-art HR-ICP-MS and dedicated sample introduction system, which will be housed in Old Dominion University's Department of Ocean, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (OEAS). This equipment represents an essential replacement and upgrade of the 16-year-old system now in place, and is critically required to meet the current and future research demands of departmental faculty and graduate researchers, as well as provide essential training and education to OEAS postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduate majors. The new analytical equipment will be maintained and operated by a dedicated research specialist who is highly experienced in HR-ICP-MS analysis, and who will receive additional specific training in the use and maintenance of the new instrument and sample introduction system.</AbstractNarration>

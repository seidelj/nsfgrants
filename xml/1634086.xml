    <AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate how the temporal aspect of auditory map symbology affects the perception of general information available from a geospatial map. The project will enhance general understanding of how timing in the delivery of spatial information influences a listener's ability to make sense of that information, and it will contribute to cartographic theory that is outside of its traditional visual emphasis. Project results will assist in the design of audio-based cartographic displays, which will facilitate increased participation in discussion and analysis of geospatial information by a diverse population of map readers, including those who are blind or who have limited vision. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geographic maps serve an important role in the communication of spatial information, and scientists have developed many techniques in map design that target the human visual system. However, an increasing awareness of the need to make maps accessible to people who are blind or who have limited vision as well as the growing size and complexity of digital data sets have prompted scientists to explore audio as an alternative to established cartographic techniques. Previous research has identified several areas of the brain that are associated with the processing of spatial information and other areas that are related to understanding the temporal sequence of events. In the conduct of this research project, the doctoral student will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record brain activity in response to sequential and concurrent presentation of spatial information through audio while participants make judgements about the geospatial information that they hear. The fMRI data will quantify differences in the level of activity in the brain areas of interest. These data will address two research questions: (1) How does the temporal aspect of an auditory map display influence effectiveness in communicating general spatial patterns in the data? (2) How does neural activity in response to a geographic map that is presented through a serial auditory display contrast against that of a concurrent auditory display? The student will analyze the fMRI data to address these research questions, and she will make publicly available software that facilitates auditory display of geospatial information.</AbstractNarration>

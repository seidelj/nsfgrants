    <AbstractNarration>The International Botanical Congress (IBC) is the largest international conference in plant biology and extends the broadest disciplinary coverage of any such conference. It provides an opportunity for plant scientists of all disciplines to showcase their research to peers from around the world, while fostering communication and collaboration in ways that only can develop from the sort of personal interactions and networking that occur at such conferences. This proposal will support travel by graduate students and postdocs to attend the 19th International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China, July 17-29, 2017. It will support 32 participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IBC is held every six years and serves a critical role in international communication within and across disciplines in plant biology, as well as a valuable opportunity to establish international collaborations. Participation is particularly valuable for young scientists as they establish their careers. The opportunity to reach so many scientists within any individual discipline creates an unequaled opportunity for exposure by a young scientist. The once-in-six-years frequency of the Congresses means that for most young scientists, there is only one opportunity to participate in an IBC during these critical stages of professional development. The intent of this proposal is to offer awards to graduate students and postdocs who are presenting in a symposium or poster session to enable them to attend this meeting.</AbstractNarration>

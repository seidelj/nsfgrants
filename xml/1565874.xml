    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the conference "Geometric and Asymptotic Group Theory with Applications,'' held in Hoboken, New Jersey on June 13-17, 2016. The event brings people from various branches of group theory and computer science together to work on some of the many open questions in the field that are now being studied from fresh and promising perspectives; it will further strengthen the connections the field has to other branches of mathematics. The event includes a series of advanced-level mini courses on the subject matter so as to make the material available to new researchers in the field, and to discuss the perspectives and general directions for the next advances and results. The organizers are committed to increasing the visibility of women at all levels of the profession and have dedicated one of the conference days exclusively for women speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is devoted to developments in group theory focusing on groups and group actions as well as other areas of mathematics in which groups or group actions are used as a main tool. The program covers many branches of modern group theory with preference given to geometric, asymptotic, and combinatorial group theory, dynamics of group actions, probabilistic and analytic methods, interaction with ergodic theory and operator algebras, and other related fields.

<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project focuses on the growing and shifting needs of the global filtration market. Contemporary pollution and manufacturing output has resulted in a categorical expansion of filtration needs and new applications. Traditional and modern day air filtration relies heavily on HEPA/ULPA filters, a particular type of high purity fiberglass extruded filter system, which dominates despite the bulk and cost to both the environment and the consumers. HEPA filters make up the majority of filters, and petroleum based, non-biodegradable and multiple filter systems are often needed and employed in series (with for example, carbon filters and UV lamps) to adequately provide the desired filtration results. In comparison, this project focuses on nanofilteration methods and materials which achieves much higher efficacy at a fraction of the energy production cost and is a holistic system of composites that utilizes charged attraction to overcome traditional efficacy barriers. Applicable industries include Biomedical, Semiconductor, Manufacturing, Automotive, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project centers around a novel biodegradable nanotech air filtration platform that includes a nano-mesh of biomimetic functionalized nanofibers to eliminate harmful air pollutants. This project utilizes biodegradable polymeric nanofibers (i.e. chitosan, cellulose) that are naturally derived and modified to target specific pollutants in the air. By using these abundant raw natural polysaccharides, the resulting filtration platform is biocompatible, biodegradable, low cost, and nontoxic. This project includes operation methods and formulations, ideal composite synthesis methods to achieve specific filtration results (i.e. selective targeting of pollutants such as viruses and bacteria), and industrial scale apparatuses and methods. The filtrate material is composed of a nonwoven polymeric nanofiber mesh, and a porous substrate onto which the mesh is attached. The utilization of a nanofiltration platform also allows for ultra high efficacy at a fraction of volume of traditional filtration systems. With the product efficacy results there maybe enough value proposition to potential customers especially in contrast to the status quo product.</AbstractNarration>

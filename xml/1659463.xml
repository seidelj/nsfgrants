    <AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) located in Woods Hole, MA will receive renewed funding for two years. The award supports ten undergraduate students per year in the ten to twelve-week Summer Student Fellow (SSF) Program. Students are selected following a national search and are matched with mentors from the large number of scientists at WHOI who focus on a wide variety of research topics. They receive a stipend, housing and travel to and from their home to WHOI. Students complete a research project, participate in a seminar series, professional development workshops and field trips, and complete a final research paper and a poster. Many Fellows have an opportunity to present their work at a scientific conference after the program. Tracking of summer Fellows since 2011 shows about 80% of SSF alumni are in science graduate programs or working in a scientific/technical field, and therefore, the WHOI REU program provides an important contribution towards training of the nation's scientific and technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU Fellows at WHOI have the opportunity to work on a wide variety of scientific research topics. Each Fellow will receive one-on-one mentoring from a researcher who works in one of WHOI's five academic departments and one Center, or at the U.S Geological Survey. The WHOI Departments are Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering, Biology, Geology and Geophysics, Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry, and Physical Oceanography. The WHOI Marine Policy Center has research opportunities focused on maritime law, environmental quality, and marine resources.</AbstractNarration>

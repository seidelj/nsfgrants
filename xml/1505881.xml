    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the PACIFIC ?Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology Including Fundamental InteraCtions? 2015 Symposium. It will be held September 14-20, 2015 at the University of California Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. The title reflects the scope of the conference, which will target the rapidly developing field at the interface of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. Thanks to the ample new data and a plethora of theoretical ideas, the field of astro-particle physics has become the source of excitement and discoveries. The symposium will bringing together researchers from the United States, Asia, Australia, South America, and Europe. This symposium will focus on the latest developments at the interface of particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and on their ramifications for understanding fundamental interactions, providing students and early career scientists an opportunity to both become aware of the latest developments and become acquainted with the global community in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, the NSF support provided through this award has a particular focus on early career scientists and graduate students. To make the symposium more accessible to the general public, the organizers have also integrated a public lecture by one of the symposium speakers into the schedule.</AbstractNarration>

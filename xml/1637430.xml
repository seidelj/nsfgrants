    <AbstractNarration>The investigators outline a summer seminar (workshop), specifically for HBCU engineering faculty (i.e., tenured associate professors) and undergraduate students (i.e., rising juniors). The overall intent of the seminar is to increase the number of underrepresented faculty in engineering; amplify collaborative opportunities between HBCU engineering faculty and National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Engineering Research Centers (ERCs) faculty; and expose HBCU students to tips and strategies for preparing and applying to engineering graduate programs, particularly at ERC-funded institutions. Generally speaking, the seminar project offers an abundance of opportunities, where HBCU engineering faculty and students are able to network with each other as well as their ERC peers. Further, the project presents immense potential to establish strong collaborations between HBCU engineering faculty and engineering faculty at NSF-funded ERCs. It also offers great broadening participation opportunities for HBCU students to be exposed to ERC engineering faculty and the different opportunities available at the ERC institutions. This workshop is timely because of its potential to broadening participation in engineering, particularly at NSF-funded ERC institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In regard to HBCU engineering faculty, the seminar will provide critical information that will help associate professors to continue to make successful progress towards promotion to the rank of professor. Further, faculty participants will be provided coaching and assistance with portfolio development and will be exposed to various research and grant opportunities at the NSF and other potential grant and research collaborative opportunities at NSF-funded ERCs, and, specifically to HBCU undergraduate students, the seminar will offer specific strategies and tips for applying for engineering graduate programs, particularly at NSF-funded ERC institutions. It will also provide these students with information on preparing for the GRE, applying for financial support, and completing a competitive graduate application.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>1511138(Willis)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plasmonics is a general term that describes a broad array of research activity to study the interaction of light with noble metal nanostructures. Noble metals are metals that are resistant to corrosion and oxidation in moist air. Ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold are noble metals. The field of plasmonics is growing rapidly due an increasing number of studies on the applications of plasmonic materials. These applications are for their uses in photocatalysis, as biochemical sensors, as photodetectors, and for solar energy harvesting, including harvesting infrared (IR) wavelengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central features of plasmonic materials are localized surface plasmon resonances that lead to strong absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by small metal particles. An experimental research program to investigate tunable plasmonic nano structures is planned, with an emphasis on process schemes for electrical connectivity. The central features of plasmonic materials are localized surface plasmon resonances that lead to strong absorption and scattering of visible and near-IR radiation by small noble metal particles. The resonances are sensitive to the size and shape of nanostructures as well as the dielectric properties of the materials and surroundings, and can be tuned throughout the visible/near-IR region. The coupling of optical phenomena and charge transfer processes is one of the exciting new areas of the science of plasmonic materials. In this work, the PI plans to investigate atomic layer deposition of noble metals on Pd nanostructures to tune the optical and electrical properties of electrically conductive nanostructures coupled by nanogaps on the order of a few nanometers. Atomic layer deposition will be used to create electrically coupled plasmonic nanostructures that combine optical and electrical phenomena at the nanoscale. This research should enhance the ability to engineer useful structures at the nanoscale with critical dimensions on the order of 1 nm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts encompass STEM educational and outreach activities, including building infrastructure for education through new senior laboratory experiments, starting a new graduate student mentoring program, supporting undergraduate research and participation by underrepresented student populations, and hosting high school students and teachers for summer learning activities.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>1536171/Petravick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Dark Energy Survey (DES) project is a major step forward in probing the physical origin of cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark energy. It consists of two pieces: a deep, multi-band map covering 5000 square degrees, and a "cosmic movie" of a thirty square-degree region obtained by revisiting that area at least once every six nights. The wide-area survey will measure positions, shapes, fluxes, and approximate (photometric) redshifts for around 300 million galaxies, and the time-domain survey will discover and measure light curves for several thousand supernovae and other transients. Data collection began in August 2013 and is planned to run for five annual, six-month observing seasons. Wide community and public access to the DES data are a vital component of the DES Data Management system, and will make the survey valuable in the long run to groups far beyond those actually carrying out the survey. DES uses the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a new wide-field, facility instrument built by the DES collaboration and installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports continued operation of the DES Data Management (DM) system at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) from January 2016 to August 2021, that is, through the end of DES survey science operations. A fully calibrated and completely re-reduced public dataset covering the entire survey will be issued around the end of FY 2020. DESDM processes raw images into science-ready data products. This involves: (1) nightly processing of DES images, (2) annual processing of all images at the end of each observing season and release of a database to the Collaboration; (3) improvements in reduction algorithms, in close concert with the science working groups; (4) production of calibrated, single-epoch images released via the Science Archive at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory; (5) production and dissemination of two major public releases of data products, one based on the first two DES observing seasons (DR1), and the second based on the full DES survey (DR2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to their use for the primary science goals, the public release of DES images and catalogs stimulates a wide variety of research by the astronomy community, as well as significant engagement in citizen science by the general public. These archival research projects will go well beyond the scientific goals of the DES. DESDM staff are also involved with outreach to dual language elementary school students in Urbana, and the promotion of math- and science-oriented careers among middle school girls in east-central Illinois. DESDM software codes are all open source and their distribution encourages broader community use.</AbstractNarration>

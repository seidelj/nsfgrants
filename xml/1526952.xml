    <AbstractNarration>Major advances in computer science have come from finding connections between different areas and then exploiting them in nontrivial ways. In this project, the PI seeks new connections and plans to capitalize on these and known connections among several areas of randomness and computational complexity. Computational complexity explores which problems are computationally intractable and why, as well as tradeoffs between computational resources such as time, space, and randomness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Randomness is extremely useful in computer science and widely used in practice. When simulating complex phenomena, such as the weather or the economy, it is standard to include random components. Computer security is impossible without randomness. Yet while randomness is provably necessary for computer security, it is not known whether it is provably necessary for algorithms. A major question in computing is to understand the power of randomness and whether it is really necessary for algorithms. Research addressing this question often focuses on two fundamental objects: pseudorandom generators and randomness extractors. A pseudorandom generator is a deterministic algorithm that expands a small number of random bits into a large number of pseudorandom bits, where algorithms using these pseudorandom bits behave similarly to algorithms using perfectly random bits. A randomness extractor is a deterministic algorithm that converts a large amount of low-quality randomness into a smaller, but still large, amount of high-quality randomness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has several themes. How do pseudorandom generators and randomness extractors relate to lower bounds for computational problems? How do pseudorandom generators and randomness extractors relate to cryptography, the mathematical foundations of computer security? How do randomness extractors relate to error-correcting codes, which enable reliable transmission over noisy media? How do codes relate to machine learning? How do pseudorandom generators relate to computational biology? By finding and exploiting these connections, we can greatly advance knowledge in the underlying areas and increase the chances of breakthroughs. Several application areas are important to society. Understanding molecular structure could impact biology, medicine, and drug design. Improvements in cryptography could lead to improved computer security. Machine learning addresses the omnipresent big data.</AbstractNarration>

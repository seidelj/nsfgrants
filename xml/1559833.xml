    <AbstractNarration>Title: REU Site: Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Nanomaterials Science and Engineering with Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Sustainable plastics; high efficiency photovoltaics; therapeutic nanoparticles; spintronic devices; plastic electronics - these are all exciting, emerging technologies that depend on nanomaterials development, and that can inspire undergraduate researchers. For ten weeks each summer, ten undergraduate students and six pre-college teachers will participate in a broad array of activities that will prepare them to tackle these and other challenging problems in science and engineering. Students will gain exposure to a broad range of topics centered around the area of nanomaterials while being prepared for graduate school and future careers in science and engineering. Teachers will gain hands-on laboratory experiences to help them better understand the practice of science and engineering and subsequently communicate it to their students. Students and teachers will work with faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students with distinguished track records in research and education, emphasizing a rich array of interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The experience will train the next generation of science and engineering professionals while increasing participation of traditionally underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The UMN MRSEC comprises three Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) addressing pressing problems over a wide range of 'hard' to 'soft' materials: IRG-1, Electrostatic Control of Materials; IRG-2, Sustainable Nanocrystal Materials; and IRG-3, Hierarchical Multifunctional Macromolecular Materials. Each IRG integrates the six basic elements of materials science and engineering - synthesis, theory, structural characterization, property evaluation, processing and applications - required for effective innovation in materials research and development. To enable talented and ambitious students to tackle these and other frontier nanomaterials challenges, the University of Minnesota Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (UMN MRSEC) will couple cutting-edge research practiced in the Center with a multi-tiered mentoring program and an extensive program in professional development and skill building. For ten weeks each summer, ten undergraduate students will participate in a comprehensive collection of activities designed to offer in-depth, stimulating research experiences, foster mentoring relationships with faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, and enhance student skills in preparation for graduate school. The programing is designed to promote and assure inclusion of females and underrepresented minorities in the preparation of the next generation of scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Jamie Walls from the University of Miami (UM) and colleagues Vaidhyanathan Ramamurthy and Burjor Captain have acquired a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer equippped with solid state capabilities. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as the study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the study of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the changing interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is located in a general user facility managed by highly qualified scientists is an integral part of research, research training and teaching. The improved research infrastructure further enriches the research experience for economically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority high school students in Miami-Dade county that participate in UM bridge programs within the Chemistry Department. Additionally, the spectrometer provides solid-state NMR and microimaging capabilities that had been unavailable in South Florida. Access to the instrument fosters collaborations between UM and local industries, colleges and universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) investigating trimetallic nanoclusters incorporated as heterogeneous catalysts; (b) studying supramolecular host/guest complexes functionalized on solid surfaces and crystals; (c) analyzing spin dynamics in dipolar and quadrupolar coupled spin systems; (d) characterizing the formation of peroxycarbonates, and (e) obtaining the direct metabolic profiling of biological tissue samples.</AbstractNarration>

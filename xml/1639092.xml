<AbstractNarration>This projects uses advanced image processing algorithms and 3D visualization techniques to support new methods of nondestructive testing as well as other sensing applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an efficient nondestructive testing (NDT) tool, currently used for many applications such as civil infrastructure inspection, mine detection, buried explosive hazards detection, geophysical sensing, and utilities detection. While there are commercially available GPR technologies for data collection, typically, they do not enable three-dimensional (3D) data reconstruction and visualization. Current software for processing GPR data offers two-dimensional (2D) data interpretation, making it difficult to interpret and visualize the condition of inspected/detected objects. This project will compliment already existing GPR technology for data analysis and visualization by integrating 3D visualization. With 3D visualization, it is possible to generate accurate interpretations of an area being inspected, without spending extra money and time to train personnel to interpret 2D data. The anticipated customers of the proposed innovation are, but not limited to, GPR software developers, geophysical sensing users, bridge engineers/contractors, and civil infrastructure inspectors. The objective of this NSF I-Corps project is to explore the commercial viability of the 3D model software which can be used to efficiently analyze various GPR data types. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enhanced GPR data analysis software, based on advanced image processing algorithms and 3D visualization, will provide new methodologies to nondestructive testing and other uses of GPR. The successful commercialization of this project will provide new NDT software-assisted sensing and inspection systems that will be comprehensive, rapid, and low cost for geophysical sensing, civil infrastructure inspection and evaluation as well as other potential applications. During the I-Corps program, this I-Corps team will focus on: (1) finalizing the 3D model software to fit with each type of GPR; (2) comprehensive testing of the software for various GPR types; 3) interviewing at least 100 customers to identify the market need; and(4) developing commercialization plans for the proposed software.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>PI: Anvari, Bahman&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No.: 1509218&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique contribution of this proposed work is the ability to engineer nanoparticles that can be made using the patient's own erythrocytes to extend the circulation time and minimize biocompatibility issues so that these nanoparticles can interact with tumors. Light energy can then be used with the nanoparticles to generate heat and provide localized hyperthermia at the tumor to destroy it or augment chemo or radiotherapy. Personalized medicine has great potential and this work can make important contributions to this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective treatment with a minimum of side effects of various malignant tumors remains an important problem in modern medicine. Personalized medicine gives the opportunity to direct and optimize such treatment to individual patients based upon their genetic and immunological makeup. This proposal will develop ghost erythrocytes loaded with fluorescent dyes as theranostic agents to image cancer cells by fluorescence and also to induce photothermal killing damage. The erythrocytes will be functionalized with an antibody to target tumors in vivo in xenograft mouse models. The PI has had many under-represented students in his lab. Aspects of the work will be incorporated into a new class.</AbstractNarration>

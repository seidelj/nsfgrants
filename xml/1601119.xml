    <AbstractNarration>The Pacific Islands are an exceptional natural laboratory, with highly diverse and unique coral reef and terrestrial ecosystems that are already under elevated levels of stress and degradation due to the effects of changing global environmental conditions, development pressures, and the effects of overfishing and coastal pollution. The future of the Islands and their populations depends on the technical skills and knowledge available to local resource managers, policy makers and stakeholders. This project will provide critical access to accurate and adequate technical information to strengthen the capacity of the local institutions of higher education. Input from local agencies, businesses and stakeholders have identified key technological skills needed by community college graduates to fill positions within the governments, NGO community and private sector. These students will develop strong STEM-related skills to enter the U.S. Mainland workforce in technology related fields and to successfully pursue 4-year and graduate degrees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance marine and environmental science education at the five minority-serving community colleges of the Pacific Islands: American Samoa Community College, the College of Micronesia - FSM, the College of the Marshall Islands, Northern Marianas College, and Palau Community College. The project will support relevant curriculum development, the professional development of the college faculty, internships and field experiences for students, and strengthen the scientific infrastructure of the participating institutions. The focus will be on island ecosystems and climate science, and activities will include advanced training for faculty to modernize their courses, expanded use of new tools and technologies, and support for student internships and research experiences.</AbstractNarration>

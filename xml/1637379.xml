    <AbstractNarration>This project will support attendance of young faculty, under-represented minority scientists, PUI faculty, along with graduate students and post-docs at the 2016 Plant and Microbial Cytoskeleton Gordon Research Conference to be held at the Proctor Academy in Andover, NH, August 14-19, 2016. The meeting will consist of short talks, poster sessions, communal dining, and conversations that will provide ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cytoskeleton of plant, fungi, and plants play important roles in cell division, cellular trafficking, and wall organization in these groups of organism. The Broader Impacts of this work involves both the importance of the cytoskeleton to a range of organisms, as well as the training of new scientist to pursue research in these fields. Cutting-edge or late-breaking research will be highlighted in several short talks chosen from the abstracts. The primary purposes of this conference are to promote discussion between scientists with common professional interests, including those from non-research-intensive colleges and universities, to foster the exchange of ideas from advanced aspects of their field, and to enable scientific collaborations to evolve in new directions.</AbstractNarration>

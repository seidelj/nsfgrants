    <AbstractNarration>1644616-Gerecht&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF has made an award in support of registration fees and travel costs for invited speakers and students to attend the "International Conference on Stem Cell Engineering 2016 (ICSCE 2016)" being held in the Toronto Marriott Bloor Yorkville, Toronto, Canada, October 23-26, 2016. This unique multidisciplinary conference, with approximately 150 attendees expected, brings together biologists, physician-scientists and engineers to discuss ways in which their disciplines can collaborate to find novel solutions to stem cell engineering problems. Of special importance are identifying fundamental studies needed to translate findings into clinical practice, e.g., 1) approaches to monitor stem cell responses, 2) enhancement of regeneration through material properties, 3) assessing the immunological response during regeneration, and 4) the accurate design of clinical trials. Aims are to provide a venue for: 1) growing the scientific exchange among Stem Cell Engineering researchers; 2) scientific presentations from a diverse group of leading biology, chemistry and engineering researchers who cover the breadth of Stem Cell Engineering; 3) interactions between academic and industry researchers, who bring different approaches and perspectives to the field; 4) interactions between clinicians and scientists working towards understanding stem cells towards regenerative medicine therapeutics; 5) active participation and networking of Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers, who represent the future of Stem Cell Engineering; and 6)bringing scientists and engineers together to provide an atmosphere and venue to discuss their disciplines and approaches, and to motivate new research into barriers limiting the development of Stem Cell technologies. The meeting will be publicized via a conference web site and announcements will be sent to SBE and AIChE Division 15 (Food, Pharmaceutical and Bioengineering) members, previous conference attendees and prominent academic and industry researchers in the field. These publicity platforms will also be used to solicit applications for student/postdoc travel awards, which will be reviewed on the bases of merit, need, and participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities. Conference proceedings will be produced and made available online. This is the first in a series of conferences expected to be held every two years</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Every two years, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference brings together leading members of the scientific community, graduate students, and postdocs to discuss new, cutting-edge research projects in marine chemistry within an informal setting. The National Science Foundation, along with the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of at least 15 graduate students/postdocs and 31 invited speakers/discussion leaders/chairs to the 2015 Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2015, the Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference will be held July 26-31, 2015 at the Holderness School in Holderness, New Hampshire. The theme for the conference will be " Processes at Interfaces: Bridging Spatial, Temporal and Disciplinary Divides from Micro- to Global Scales " with the aims to highlight new approaches available in the field of chemical oceanography to address cutting edge questions on this theme. The primary goal of the conference is to provide a forum that brings together scientists that are leading contributors in the field of marine chemistry along with graduate students and postdocs to exchange ideas on new, innovative research. Presentations and discussions at the 2015 Gordon Conference will center around the following session topics: (1) Processes and Cycling at the Land-Sea Interface; (2) Microbe-Organic Matter Interactions and Transformations; (3) Biogeochemical Cycling at the Seabed-Water Column Interface; (4) Phosphorus: The Interface Between Geochemistry, Biology and Geology; (5) Biogeochemical Processes in Oxygen Deficient Environments: Metal, Sulfur and Nitrogen Cycling; (6) Reactions and Fluxes at the Air-Sea Interface; (7) Nutrient-Trace Metal Interactions: Cycling at the Particle-Seawater Interface; (8) Biogeochemistry at Deep-Sea Vents: Thermal and Redox Transition Zones; and (9) The Ocean?s Role in Climate Change. The Chemical Oceanography Gordon Research Conference has become recognized as an important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine chemistry and to forge new scientific alliances.</AbstractNarration>

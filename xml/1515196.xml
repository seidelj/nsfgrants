    <AbstractNarration>Low-permeability sandstones, or tight sandstones, can become unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs due to hydraulic fracturing. The Late Triassic (228-208 million years ago) Yanchang Formation in the Ordos Basin is the largest discovered tight sandstone reservoir in China. This research will apply principles of sedimentology and sequence stratigraphy to interpret a subsurface data set to create a paleogeographic reconstruction and reservoir characterization of the Yanchang Formation. This geologic framework will improve the predictability of the distribution of sandstone reservoirs in the basin. The continued evaluation of the Yanchang Formation has great significance for understanding the geologic history of the Ordos Basin and hydrocarbon exploration. This work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Bingsong Yu, a noted expert on the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Ordos Basin, at China University of Geosciences, Beijing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Yanchang Formation records a variety of terrestrial depositional environments and the tectonic evolution of the Ordos Basin. Extensive semi-deep and deep lacustrine (lake) sediments developed in the central and southern parts of the basin, resulting in mudstone deposition. The sandstones of river mouth sandbars in the north are composed of fine-grained (125-250 Âµm sand grains), low-permeability (3-5 millidarcy), arkosic (feldspar-rich) sandstones. These sandbar hydrocarbon reservoirs are located close in proximity to lacustrine source rocks. The overlying mudstones formed a regionally extensive seal that trapped hydrocarbons in the low-permeability sandstones. Modeling based on seismic reflection and well log data will result in a sequence stratigraphic framework which will identify time correlative surfaces, the distribution of sand bodies and the interconnectivity of reservoirs. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>

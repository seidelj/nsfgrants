    <AbstractNarration>The International School of Cosmic Ray Astrophysics (ISCRA) is a biannual summer school designed to provide an overview of the field to graduate students and young postdoctoral scholars through both lectures and informal discussions with Particle Astrophysics experts. This is the only regular Particle Astrophysics summer school in the world and it has an excellent history of training future leaders in the field. The 20th ISCRA course will take place in Erice, Italy, from the 1st to the 7th of August 2016. The theme of the Course is "Particle, Gamma-ray and Neutrino Astrophysics in the 21st Century." The sessions will include discussions of new experiments, new experimental results and the new understanding of those results, emphasizing the multi-messenger approach to astrophysics. This award will support the participation of US graduate students and young postdoctoral scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topics for discussion during the 20th ISCRA include the highest energy particles and neutrinos, balloon, satellite and ground based measurements of cosmic rays and gamma rays, neutrino underwater and under-ice observatories, acceleration and propagation of high-energy radiation through the Universe, and the new space- or ground-based experiments of the near future. Proceedings are published to more broadly disseminate the results.</AbstractNarration>

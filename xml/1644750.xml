<AbstractNarration>This project proposes to create an I-Corps Site at California State University - Northridge. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The California State University Northridge (CSUN) I-Corps Site brings together an experienced innovation ecosystem to help foster the growth of potential entrepreneurs on campus and in the San Fernando Valley (SFV) region. The CSUNInnovates! program, a campus-wide program designed to integrate all innovation resources on campus, developed a strategic partnership with the widely known Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) to expand on the entrepreneurial support provided to students, faculty, and alumni. LACI@CSUN was created in 2014 out of a vision to create a world-class entrepreneurial capability and culture at CSUN and establish the SFV region's reputation as a leader in technological innovation and entrepreneurship. If successful, this project has the potential to impact both the institution and the region.</AbstractNarration>

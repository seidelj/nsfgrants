<AbstractNarration>Students who have embraced, learned, and experienced the innovation process will be well prepared to become leading innovators. As part of this project, the PIs will expose students to the new product development process, implement activities to foster creativity, and apply these principles to designs of devices that support persons with disabilities.  Further, to broaden the experiences of undergraduates across the nation, the PIs will sponsor a national design competition for the next three years at the annual Summer Biomechanics, Biotransport and Bioengineering Conference (SB3C) where projects from the design class will also be submitted. Companies like AT&amp;T and American Express sponsor online creativity contests to inspire innovation, additionally, crowdfund platforms like Kickstarter have ideas compete to win funding. Organizations are using competitions to drive innovation and foster creativity within their own workforces; a similar approach is proposed here for undergraduate students. There are two primary goals for this work: 1) to foster innovation and creativity in an undergraduate design course at the PI's university through a new educational model, and 2) to provide three-years of support for a national design competition in the area of rehabilitation and assistive devices for undergraduates. The competition will help drive innovation in classes across the nation and then allow students and their mentors to showcase their products. The intellectual merits of this proposal are in the implementation of a new approach for teaching design innovation through fostering creativity by implementing independent discovery, creative thinking skills, a motivational component in the form of a competition, and demonstrating the need and benefit of having an inter-disciplinary team. The motivational component is tied both to the design class and to the national undergraduate competition presented in this proposal.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will implement a new teaching model in an existing Biomechanical Design class with the goal of fostering creativity. This will occur through a four component approach including: 1) expertise through discovery, 2) creative thinking, 3) motivation and 4) an appreciation for team diversity. As part of the motivation component, we will hold an in-class competition, and also enter student teams into the national undergraduate design competition held at SB3C. In addition, the Undergraduate Design Competition in Rehabilitation and Assistive Devices is a national competition, open to all undergraduate design teams who have developed devices to support rehabilitation or provide assistance to individuals with disabilities. With support for this competition, undergraduate student teams and their advisors from across the nation will have a component of motivation for their course innovations. A cohort of faculty, selected by the PI, who have design experience, will review and score the abstract submissions.  Based on these scores, the top six teams (approximately 30 students and their mentors) will be invited to attend the conference and present their device, design, and business case at a special podium session. All other entries will be invited to the conference as poster presentations. By promoting innovation and creativity in the classroom, students will be better positioned for the highly competitive job market; the students exposed to this class and the national competition will not only have an additional set of skills, but they will have a project with a functional prototype to demonstrate as an outcome.  Also, societal benefits will occur through the production of a cohort of students who are mindful of the need for diversity in the innovation process, and who are aware of the needs for persons with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>

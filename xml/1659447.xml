    <AbstractNarration>A new Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Oregon Eugene's Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB) located in Charleston, OR will be developed with this award. The program will support a total of ten students each summer for a nine-week research program. The project model includes offering research opportunities to students from 2-year colleges using a tiered learning model with pairs of students working with mentors to conduct research. Funding supports student stipends, housing and student travel expenses from their home to the site. A total of thirty students will gain experience in scientific research and participate in a variety of professional development workshops during the three years of the grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will have the opportunity to conduct research in a wide range of biological sciences, including research on the ecology of invertebrate embryos, larvae, and juveniles; trophic interactions in food webs; biology and systematics of the ribbon worms; ecological interactions of organisms with coastal physical oceanographic and environmental processes; the ecology and hydromechanical function in gelatinous zooplankton; cell biology; estuarine fish and invertebrate ecology, and the ecology of deep-sea and subtidal invertebrates.</AbstractNarration>

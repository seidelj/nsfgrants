    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project begins first are foremost with integration of these 3-d interactive displays with mass produced electronic devices. From the small scale (watches, smartphones) to the large scale (collaborative workplace displays), adding pressure and temperature sensitivity could introduce a whole new level of input and functionality. In addition to improving functionality and productivity, these displays could widen the capabilities of gesture-based input for the elderly and disabled. The multi-touch display market exceeds $10 billion and continues to grow, indicating a massive commercial opportunity. However, combined pressure- and temperature-sensitive films can have broader applications beyond displays. A natural extension for these sensors is wearable devices, especially those aimed at preventative and diagnostic healthcare (e.g. monitoring blood pressure, core temperature, wound healing). Another logical application is robotics, where combined pressure and temperature sensor arrays can function as ?electronic skin?, mimicking the pressure and temperature sensitivity of human skin. Finally, since this class of sensors is compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing processes, they are expected to be low in cost, which would enable a future in which walls, windows, floors, and other surfaces can be infused with pressure and temperature sensitivity, adding significantly to the Internet of Things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on developing multi-touch displays that are responsive to both pressure and temperature, in order to create a truly 3-dimensional interactive display experience. A handful of commercial touch displays already offer pressure sensitivity, which extends user input ?into the screen?, but including sensitivity to temperature could allow user input ?above the screen? as well. It may now be possible to introduce both temperature and pressure sensitivity to displays by using a new class of transparent, polymer-based, thin-film pressure and temperature sensor arrays. These sensor arrays utilize finely-tuned transparent polymers that are highly sensitive to either pressure or temperature. The goal of this research is to develop a single transparent film with both pressure and temperature sensitivity, and to integrate this film beneath the glass of a display. This will first require combining the pressure- and temperature-sensitive films without deteriorating the sensitivity of either one, by experimenting with lamination and deposition techniques. Another key activity will be to improve the transparency of the temperature-sensitive film by adjusting its material composition. Finally, the sensitivity of this film under a glass cover will need to be evaluated through extensive input testing.</AbstractNarration>

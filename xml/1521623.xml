    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to support travel awards for student/fellows and young independent investigators (Rising Stars) for the 2015 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES)-Cellular and Molecular Bioengineering (CMBE) conference. Mechanobiology studies the role that touch, stretch, compression and shear has on the development of biological systems. These fundamental responses affect the development of embryos, the healing of wounds, the basic function of heart, skin and other organs of the body and also fundamental responses of non-human organisms from bacterial to mammal to the mechanical stresses of life. This support will aid in the training of new students and rising stars in this area who will do research in this area in years to come. Developing an understanding of the effects of mechanical loading on biological systems is of direct interest to the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology program: Supporting the development of young investigators in this area is of fundamental importance to succesful future research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theme of the 2015 conference is 'From Womb to Tomb: Mechanobiology of Generation, Regeneration and Degeneration.' This is directly related to the mission of the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology program and also is in line with the mission of Biomedical Engineering which is partially supporting this request. Sixteen graduate students/postdoctoral fellows will be selected by the organizing committee to receive Student/Fellow Awards and present short talks, which will be integrated into the sessions. In addition, six junior independent investigators will be selected for a special Rising Star session, which will take place on the first day of the meeting in order to showcase their work. Support from the NSF will be used to provide partial support to students, post-doctoral fellows, young investigators (Rising Stars), and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

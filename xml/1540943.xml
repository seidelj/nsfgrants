    <AbstractNarration>Electrophysiology has long played an important role in our understanding of brain dynamics in learning, but only at an individual level. With the advent of low-cost, easy to use electroencephalography (EEG) devices that can measure brain responses from an entire classroom at a time, it is now possible to study group brain dynamics during learning in a naturalist classroom setting. This is opportunity to gather data from thousands of students and schools will provide insights not available from earlier approaches. There is however, a critical need to rigorously define how this technology might play a role in improving learning. To address this need, the present project will form a research network of experts to develop and test new EEG methods to measure group brain dynamics. This network includes experts in child development, learning EEG technology, classroom teaching and outreach. Collaborative research will be conducted in three geographic areas reflecting diverse populations: San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Washington DC Area. The research will focus on assessing important foundational skills: using EEG to assess the quality of encoding of speech by the brain, using EEG to assess attention in real-time, and examining the role of temporal synchronization in promoting attentional behaviors. In addition to research the project features a strong commitment to building interdisciplinary connections within science, as well as vigorously engaging the study communities in the research to foster productive dialog among educators, students, and other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EEG techniques have made important contributions to understanding dynamic processes in learning, attention, prospection, memory, and executive function. Newer measures, such as the complex Auditory Brainstem Response (cABR) reveal how the brain encodes sound, providing a powerful tool to link brain function to reading and language impairment. Traditional EEG methods are too cumbersome and intrusive for large- scale classroom use. Network researchers have developed a transformative low-cost, dry-electrode, high sampling rate EEG system that is ergonomic and suitable for children. Their software innovations, which enable the synchronization of large-group EEG recordings, will support data recording from twenty+ students simultaneously. These will contribute to at least two innovations in education-based research: 1) It will be possible for a large number of traditional, individual EEG tests to be conducted in parallel, vastly increasing study efficiency, yield and power, and 2) the more revolutionary step of assessing individual and group brain dynamics in ecological learning environments to obtain real-time insight into the dynamics of learning, speech comprehension, and attention. Four experimental goals have been proposed: 1) Identifying Individual Learning Differences with cABR, 2) Developing measures of nested hierarchical processing of speech, 3) Developing protocols for individual and group cognitive state (attention, alertness) assessment, and 4) examining how brain dynamics at a group level reflect speech comprehension in a classroom setting. In addition to its scientific goals, the network will foster scientific dialog by hosting a Workshop on "Brain Dynamics in Learning" to develop a roadmap for future research in the field.</AbstractNarration>

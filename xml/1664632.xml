<AbstractNarration>Replacing precious metal catalysts with those using inexpensive and abundant metals is a major challenge faced by the chemistry community as precious metal resources dwindle and the focus on the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing increases. Successfully utilizing non-precious metal catalysts improves the sustainability, economics, and environmental impact of many technologies that are crucial to society.  However, accomplishing this requires the development of new non-precious catalysts that function as well as, or better than, established precious metal catalysts. In this project, Dr. Mankad is developing a new strategy for catalyzing reactions of importance to the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The concept uses two non-precious metals to achieve chemical reactions typically conducted with a single precious metal. In addition to achieving the targeted chemical reactions, development of these innovative catalysts stands to impact many other areas of chemistry that rely on catalysis. Dr. Mankad is leading a diverse team of researchers and is promoting their engagement in outreach and leadership activities in their university and community. These activities, which include conducting chemistry demonstrations for urban middle school students in Chicago, promoting laboratory safety in research and teaching settings, and disseminating research results to a wide range of audiences, are promoting both interest in STEM disciplines and engagement in the issues of sustainability and environmental responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With funding from the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Mankad of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is developing bimetallic strategies for C-C and C-X coupling reactions that utilize two base metals cooperatively to achieve transformations typically conducted using single-site noble metal catalysts. The targeted transformations include carbonylative C-C coupling reactions (typically catalyzed by Pd) that allow for the modular synthesis of ketone products from simple starting materials, dehydrogenative C-H borylation reactions (typically catalyzed by Ir) that allow for direct synthesis of arylboronic esters that are valuable synthetic building blocks, and alkyne semi-hydrogenation reactions (typically catalyzed by Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir) that exhibit unusual stereoselectivity dictated by the bimetallic reaction mechanism. The cooperation of two or more metals during catalysis is an under-developed design strategy, and so this project stands to have a broad impact on many other areas of chemistry that depend on catalysis. Dr. Mankad leads a diverse team of researchers and promotes their participation in outreach and leadership activities at UIC and in the surrounding Chicago community, including outreach to local middle school students, promotion of laboratory safety, and engagement in issues of sustainability and environmental responsibility, that further support the broader impacts of the project.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Ensuring a high level of security and reliability in the electronic computing devices is a significant challenge. Central issues include secure and reliable identification, authentication and integrity checking of underlying hardware. Hardware-based security primitives such as physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are still a work-in-progress in terms of the cost they require to guarantee reliable operation and their resistance to physical attacks. This project investigates security primitives suitable for high volume production where the allowable costs for design, integration, and testing of hardware security primitives are low. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques developed in this project utilize existing resources in the memory hierarchy to cover multiple hardware security primitives all at once. This project also verifies the effectiveness, cost, and attack vulnerabilities of the proposed primitives and techniques through extensive experiments on multiple test platforms. The benefits for society include more trustworthy, reliable, and secure verification of electronics for healthcare and dependable computing platforms for intelligence, financial transactions, energy, and military systems.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>In order to further scientific discovery, the community of researchers needs people that think critically, creatively, and innovatively. These qualities are not restricted by income, race, ethnicity, or physical ability; however, the national community of researchers still does not represent the nation as a whole. In many STEM fields, including Ecology and Evolution, people from low income households, racial minorities, and people with disabilities are not well represented in leadership positions. This is harmful both to the state of scientific discovery, and to the ideals of equality and social mobility. When promising young scientists and researchers leave the workforce or stagnate in lower positions, the scientific community misses out on potentially great minds and great discoveries. This program aims to increase the inclusion of underrepresented groups at the Southeastern Ecology and Evolution Conference by removing financial barriers to attendance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will provide 15 scholarships in order to eliminate the costs of registration, travel, food, and lodging during the weekend conference. The event will be held at The University of Georgia on 13-15 March 2015. This small regional conference is geared towards early career researchers, including undergraduates and young graduate students. Attending a small regional conference is particularly important for young researchers in underrepresented groups. Events like this can increase interest in graduate school and scientific careers, create networking and community-building opportunities, as well as help build strong presentation skills.</AbstractNarration>

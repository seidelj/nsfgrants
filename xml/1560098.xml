    <AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site initiates a School of Engineering-wide program at the University of Connecticut (UConn) to engage talented minority and community college undergraduate participants in cutting edge experimental and computational nanotechnology research. The objectives of this program are to 1) increase the quantity and quality of engineers prepared to address grand challenges through ethical use of nanoscience; 2) increase the number of students from underrepresented populations who pursue graduate education and academic research in nanotechnology-related engineering fields; and 3) build alliances with minority serving-institutions and programs to enable a sustainable pipeline of students from underrepresented groups who will become leaders in nanotechnology-related engineering fields. Students will participate directly in research with faculty mentors to address grand challenges in fields critical to domestic economic and societal progress: energy conversion, cell-drug interactions, nanoelectronics, and advanced manufacturing. The combination of career mentorship by successful role models and first-hand research experience is designed to ultimately increase participants' preparedness for academic and/or scientific research experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in nanotechnology research during a 10-week summer program, on a range of scientific projects, including: advanced nanomaterials for thermal and magnetic to electrical energy conversion, phase change memory, biological response to pharmaco-therapeutic treatments at the individual cell level, 3D printing of nanoparticle-containing wearable electronics, and designer ultra-strength metal alloys. A structured short course series instructed by participating faculty mentors will educate REU students on a broad range of nanotechnology-related research fields. In addition to active research, students will participate in a career development seminar series including the practice of ethical research. Recruitment of REU Site participants will target minority-serving programs (Ronald E. McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement Program, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation) and community colleges (Cochise College, a Hispanic Serving Institution with a large veteran population) as well as STEM teachers from UConn's Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering program (Joule Fellows).</AbstractNarration>

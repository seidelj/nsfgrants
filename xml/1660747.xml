    <AbstractNarration>Drexel Engineering Noyce (DEN) will undertake a Noyce Track 1 (Scholarships &amp; Stipends) project to recruit undergraduate engineers to consider STEM teaching careers, and aims to produce at least 26 certified, secondary STEM teachers over the five-year grant period. DEN will support authentic implementation of inquiry and engineering design in classrooms by drawing upon individuals whose undergraduate education exists at the intersection of engineering design and STEM content areas while simultaneously providing these individuals with a program of study in education and inquiry-oriented pedagogy. DEN graduates will both help ensure that the next generation of individuals are qualified to participate and lead in a STEM-centered economy and able to help address the shortage of qualified STEM teachers in the School District of Philadelphia, the primary partner district of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEN will introduce engineering specific recruitment, retention and community-building efforts, including (a) engineering-specific recruitment efforts featuring high-profile faculty, staff and student ambassadors from the College of Engineering; (b) explicitly valuing engineering as a scientific discipline and embedding engineering applications into STEM teacher certification programs; and (c) introducing DEN-specific events, such as an engineering education speaker's series, providing academic and social support and engagement opportunities for DEN participants. DEN scholars will have the opportunity to participate and present at regional and national education conferences. Alumni will participate in induction support programs designed by Drexel's School of Education to ensure that they have the tools and resources to succeed in the teaching profession. Ultimately, School District of Philadelphia schools will benefit from 26 STEM teachers uniquely positioned to effectively address the Next Generation Science Standards' call to elevate engineering design to the same level as scientific inquiry in STEM instruction.</AbstractNarration>

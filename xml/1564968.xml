    <AbstractNarration>The Institut Henri Poincar√© (IHP) will host a thematic quarter on the Nexus of Information and Computation Theories, from January 25th, 2016 to April 1st, 2016. The primary goal of this program is to explore the rich interplay between information theory and the theory of computation, and ultimately create new connections and collaborations between both scientific communities. In recent years, methods from information theory have been used to solve longstanding open problems in computer science, most notably in the realm of lower bounds in communication complexity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is organized in 4 thematic sessions, focussing on the areas of Distributed Computing, Inference Problems, Fundamental Inequalities, and Security. Each of these areas will involve talks by both Computer Scientists and Information theorists, with the intent to promote collaboration between the two areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports graduate students and postdocs from the United States to attend the quarter, in cases where attendance would not be possible without support. Each award will provide funds for accommodation and travel.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>High-end prosthetic feet have been developed to improve the mobility and function of lower-limb amputees, but a majority of amputees in the Developing World lack access to this technology. Most current Developing World prosthetic solutions do not adequately address the needs of active amputees and were not designed to pass international standard tests. Current assistive devices available range from the ultra-low cost Red Cross system to high-end systems produced by the big European manufacturers. With the focus on customers at the extreme ends of the economic spectrum there remains a niche in the market for a mid-range, trans-femoral prosthetic leg that is both affordable and high-quality. The current gap in this market will be magnified in the future by projected population growth, an increasingly aging global population, and the growing prevalence of vascular disease, leaving leading to an estimated 35 million amputees in the target market needing a prosthetic foot within 3 years. The World Health Organization has issued the call for projects and organizations that are focused on providing assistive health technologies that are both affordable and high-quality. This project seeks to answer that call by developing a low-cost, repairable, adjustable, highly functional prosthetic foot to close the technological gap and improve the outcomes for the world?s neediest amputees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students at the University of Texas at El Paso have created an energy storage and return prosthetic foot that is low cost, adaptable to a wide range of patient needs and repairable. The foot's toe section consists of several interchangeable layers. The purpose of these layers is to create a foot whose stiffness is variable and can be customized to match the weight, stride and activity level of the amputee wearing the foot. Layers are constructed by hand laying carbon fiber and epoxy into compression molds in a process that can be replicated in virtually any lab or manufacturing space. Three different layer stiffnesses, created by varying the fiber orientations in the layers of carbon fiber, offer the ability to customize the stiffness of the foot through a variety of layer combinations. A prosthetist using this technology would have a selection of standard layers in each of those three stiffnesses that can be combined to match the needs of his patient without having to order a custom foot. The stiffness of the foot can also be easily modified after it is in use if the patient finds it to be uncomfortable. The foot currently exists as a prototype with preliminary lab and patient testing done. Future work must include some small design changes and additional testing for further validation by ISO standards. Further customer discovery is also needed to ensure the value propositions of the project resonate with real customers from the program coordinator level to technicians who fit the device to the amputees themselves.</AbstractNarration>

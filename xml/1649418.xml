    <AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin-Madison will organize a workshop for REU Site Program Directors who are currently funded thru the NSF Division of Biological Infrastructure. The workshop will be held on March 28-April 1, 2017, in Arlington, VA. The goal is to share best practices and discuss important issues associated with training undergrads in the REU Site program, including designing program evaluation, enhancing mentoring experience, implementing strategies for successful recruitment of underrepresented groups, communicating scientific results to stakeholders and the public, preparing undergrads for all types of careers in STEM, and others. An existing website (www.bioreu.org) will be used for registration and submission of abstracts for the poster session scheduled at the beginning of the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will bring together approximately 140 REU Program Directors and three plenary speakers with expertise in selected areas covered by the workshop. A Planning Committee, comprised of members of the BIO REU Leadership Council, will be formed to ensure representation by a diverse group of Program Directors and institution types at the workshop. The Planning Committee will gather input from attendees on the selection of plenary speakers, topics of discussion, and format of workshop sessions. A Final Report will be produced and disseminated to the entire BIO REU community. An online survey will be administered immediately following the workshop to assess the effectiveness of the workshop. The results of this evaluation will be included in the Final Report to be submitted to NSF. More information is available by contacting the PI, Dr. Janet Branchaw at branchaw@wisc.edu.</AbstractNarration>

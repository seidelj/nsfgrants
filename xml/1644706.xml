    <AbstractNarration>This project, at the University of Georgia, creates an I-Corps Site (I-Corps UGA) at that institution. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; I-Corps UGA strengthens entrepreneurship and commercialization in the local and regional ecosystem and supports the growth and diversification of Georgia's economy. I-Corps UGA will increase the participation of women and minority students in the resulting innovation network through active collaboration with other local and regional educational institutions serving minority and underrepresented populations. By leveraging, strengthening, and expanding its existing innovation network at the University of GA, the I-Corps UGA enhances the regional and national capacity to support STEM technology development and commercialization. In doing so I-Corps UGA nurtures and supports faculty and student innovators and increases the number of STEM technologies brought to the market. This project demonstrates a strong existing foundation in Business Model Canvas and Lean Startup methodologies. Partnerships with groups such as the Office of Institutional Diversity, Peach State LSAMP, the UGA Women's Leadership Initiative, Terry College's Women's Initiative and with a HBU will lead to broader inclusion of women and underrepresented groups in the program.</AbstractNarration>

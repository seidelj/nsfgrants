    <AbstractNarration>South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (working in collaboration with South Dakota State University, University of Nebraska-Kearney, North Dakota State University and Sitting Bull College) will host a workshop to explore sustainable rural supply chain problems and Food-energy-water nexus research needs in the semi-arid Upper Great Plains. The workshop will 1) present key recent research synopses by leading experts in food, water, energy, land-use and climate; 2) identify critical FEW research needs in the UGP using strategy-based discussion groups during the conference; 3) summarize research needs into a white paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (working in collaboration with South Dakota State University, University of Nebraska-Kearney, North Dakota State University and Sitting Bull College) will host a Food-Energy-Water (FEW) Nexus workshop to explore sustainable rural supply chain problems research needs. The semi-arid Upper Great Plains UGP is a net exporter of food and energy, yet it is also the site of competing nexus interests: the Bakken shale-oil boom, corn grain ethanol production, in-situ uranium mining, coal mines, wind farms, and major hydroelectric dams compete with public and private interests in relation to land-use alternatives. Large and volatile changes in agricultural commodity and livestock prices, competing land-use for incoming bioenergy crops, increasing agricultural efficiencies through biotechnology and precision agriculture; and regional effects of climate trends and variabilities have impacted regional agriculture and water resources. Recent energy and commodity end-use developments have led to substantial regional economic growth; however it has strained infrastructure (e.g. lack of housing, power transmission, pipelines, roads/rail lines), contributed to grassland to cropland conversion, resulted in soil salinization and sodification, and reduced ground water supplies. The workshop will 1) present key recent research synopses by leading experts in food, water, energy, land-use and climate; 2) identify critical FEW research needs in the UGP using strategy-based discussion groups during the conference; 3) summarize research needs into a white paper.</AbstractNarration>

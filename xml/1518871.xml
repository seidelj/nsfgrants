    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the Midwest Algebra Geometry Combinatorics (ALGECOM) meetings, a series of biannual one-day conferences the Fall 2015 edition of which will be held on October 24, 2015, at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. The goal of these conferences is to provide an informal and collaborative atmosphere to promote interaction among Midwest mathematicians. Travel support is for graduate students and speakers. The conference will include a poster session that will permit students and postdocs to present their work. This will assist in the development of STEM research and training at a variety of Midwest institutions. Venues and dates are chosen several months in advance. Past/future locations also include DePaul University, Loyola University, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The conference website is https://sites.google.com/site/algecomday/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference series grew from a desire to bring together mathematicians with common interests (combinatorics and its interplay with commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and/or representation theory). In particular, it deepens the links between hosting Chicago universities (Depaul and Loyola) with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Purdue University, and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. These institutions have significant geographic separation; ALGECOM provides a regular meeting to stimulate interaction and synergies. Continuing support allows extension from Illinois and Indiana towards Michigan. This award continues this trend, which will in particular benefit graduate students both from the Midwest and elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

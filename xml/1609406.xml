    <AbstractNarration>Under the support of the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jean Chmielewski of Purdue University conducts research building unique structures on a very small (nano- to micro-) scale using ball and stick atomic and molecular building blocks. Professor Chmielewski studies how the size and shape of the structures they make can be controlled by changing the building blocks at a molecular level. These nano- and micro-structures may have many uses, such as delivering drugs to different parts of the body or helping to grow new organs. Professor Chmielewski trains many chemistry students who work on this project. She is working to improve the diversity of the chemistry graduate student population at Purdue University. In this way a new generation of diverse scientists will be available to tackle the technological challenges of the 21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hierarchical assembly of nanoscale building blocks into micron-scaled functional materials is a powerful strategy for the design of devices for technological applications. The Chmielewski research group has previously used collagen peptide triple helices as building blocks for higher order assembly promoted by metal-ligand interactions. In this way her group generated a range of unique nano- to micro-structures, including fibers, disks, florettes, cages and 3-dimensional matrices, which are potentially useful for biopolymer delivery, imaging agents, cell culture and tissue growth. Herein Prof. Chmielewski investigates coiled coil peptides (dimer to tetramer) and disulfide-linked helical bundle peptides (pentamer to hexamer) as alternate building blocks for metal ion-promoted higher order assembly into nano- and microscale materials. Modulating the oligomerization state of the peptide allows the control of the number of assembly signals displayed on the building block and provides the opportunity to design pores within the building block. The overall goals of this research are to have fully optimized conditions to generate distinct peptide nano- and micro-structures on demand and to develop a clear understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the assembly process.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The "Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Program (NITRD) Supplement President's Budget FY2016" cites Accelerating Transition to Practice as one of five strategic objectives in the Cyber Security and Information Assurance (CSIA) Program Component Area. However, the NSF cybersecurity portfolio contains only a small amount of security research that has been transitioned into practice. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) of the White House defines transition to practice as research that "creates measurable improvements in the cybersecurity landscape". Although NSF encourages security researchers with promising projects to submit TTP (Transition to Practice) projects, a very low percentage of submissions take advantage of the Option. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In February 2015, NSF sponsored a workshop which brought together key stakeholders to provide insights on how to improve the TTP process and encourage more TTP submissions. An important outcome of that workshop was the identification of specific barriers to TTP. In order to keep momentum going from the February 2015 workshop, this follow-on workshop identifies specific success factors for PI's as they consider how to address TTP in FY16 and following years and overcome previous barriers. It also provides NSF input as to how to shape future years' TTP programs. The expected outcome is that NSF expands the impact of the cybersecurity research it funds and produces more TTP results in the near to mid-term.</AbstractNarration>

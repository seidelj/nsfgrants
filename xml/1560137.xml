    <AbstractNarration>This project sets up a new REU site at Carnegie-Mellon University focused on multi-faceted aspects of software engineering. The program will be recruiting a diverse set of students based on stop-past-the-post strategy successfully employed previously by other sites. The site will focus on recruiting women students and students from undergraduate-only institutions with limited research exposure. The students will not only be acquiring research skills through the training program, but also gain exposure to a broader research landscape through interactions and seminars. The students will be exposed to faculty life and research career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills in software engineering have always been core to computer science, programming and software development. The project will offer research opportunity in secure languages, requirement engineering, program repair, variational data structures and API usability. The projects emphasize separate modules on training, exposure and graduate life mentoring. The project will build on the experience of many of the faculty mentors who have worked with undergraduate students in their individual research. The students will be encouraged to disseminate their research findings by publishing in quality venues and giving presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the arrangement and properties of arrays of nanoscale magnets fabricated&lt;br/&gt;by lithography methods. The fundamental physics component will investigate, both by&lt;br/&gt;experiment and modeling, the stable magnetic configuration of such arrays subject to different&lt;br/&gt;perturbations introduced by different magnetic underlayers. It will also investigate the possibility&lt;br/&gt;of (a) using such arrays for next generation magnetic recording media for information storage, and&lt;br/&gt;(b) developing a magnetic approach for logic function in information processing. &lt;br/&gt;We will study interactions that can provide much needed additional freedom to&lt;br/&gt;engineer new properties, functionalities and applications. This proposal will also enable the PI to &lt;br/&gt;combine the simultaneous advancement of discovery with teaching, training, learning, and if appropriate, commercialization.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single domain, nanoscale magnetic elements, fabricated by lithography, and patterned into&lt;br/&gt;ordered arrays, form excellent magnetic metamaterials with unusual properties. Typically, their&lt;br/&gt;behavior is dominated by macroscopic inter-element dipolar interactions, but here in addition, we&lt;br/&gt;propose microscopic exchange interactions to provide much needed additional freedom to&lt;br/&gt;engineer new properties, functionalities and applications in three distinct areas:&lt;br/&gt;(1) Geometrical frustration in a lattice of nanoscale ferromagnetic islands with dipolar interactions,&lt;br/&gt;leads to the formation of a spin-ice configuration; here we propose to investigate the materials&lt;br/&gt;physics and magnetic configuration of a spin-ice metamaterial, including its thermodynamic phase&lt;br/&gt;transitions, coupled through underlayers where the interactions between the nanoelements of the&lt;br/&gt;spin lattice are dominated by lateral exchange bias (EB). The EB, along different well-defined&lt;br/&gt;crystallographic directions, can also be added to the system at different stages of the spin-ice&lt;br/&gt;configurational evolution.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Alternatively, each element in the metamaterial can be a multilayer, with intra-element&lt;br/&gt;exchange interactions; the magnetic performance of such exchange exchange-coupled composite&lt;br/&gt;metamaterial, fabricated in large-area arrays by nanoimprint lithography, will be optimized for bitpatterned&lt;br/&gt;media.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Magnetic quantum cellular automata (MQCA) in specific nanomagnetic arrays to process&lt;br/&gt;information and perform Boolean logic operations is a promising alternative to CMOS technology.&lt;br/&gt;We will design and construct, for the first time, exchange-coupled logic gates that perform&lt;br/&gt;elementary Boolean logic operations, based on a novel design of sub-50nm nanomagnet elements;&lt;br/&gt;two representive gates (AND and OR), will be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;Micromagnetic modeling and materials characterization, both routine and advanced, using&lt;br/&gt;electrons, photons and scanning probes, will provide fundamental insight into the structure- property &lt;br/&gt;performance correlation, at appropriate length scales, of all these unique and tailored&lt;br/&gt;metamaterials. This proposal will also enable the PI to combine the simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;advancement of discovery with teaching, training, learning, and if appropriate, commercialization.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Research and Education networks (R&amp;E) networks are undergoing a major transformation. At the campus level, implementations must balance performance, security, and the flexibility to handle innovative network applications research. Without adequate performance, the core application stakeholders would quickly leave; without security, the university networks would not allow integration of new approaches; without innovations, future leadership is at stake. The Holland Computing Center (HCC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) campus has identified the need to increase the flexibility of UNL's network to support scientific users and network researchers; UNL addresses this by deploying a production software-defined network (SDN) using OpenFlow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This deployment enhances UNL's HCC network through SDN, in three focused areas. First, it enhances resource management for GridFTP transfers by having the applications communicate with an SDN controller to set up paths and path properties for large transfers. By enabling communication between the applications and the network controller, we allow for application-driven bandwidth provisioning. Second, it integrates security with SDN-based dynamic routing so that only flows that require specific middleboxes be routed through them. This increases the scalability of the network by reducing the load on middleboxes and enabling automated reaction to security alerts raised by these devices. Third, it uses Content-Centric Networking (CCN) to provide access to the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment data. CCN provides in-network caching and content-based routing. UNL leverages these techniques to efficiently deliver experiment data to scientific applications without always requiring access to the server where the data is stored.</AbstractNarration>

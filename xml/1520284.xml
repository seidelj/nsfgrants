    <AbstractNarration>Phase I project is to improve the quality of care for patients who suffer from internal&lt;br/&gt;scarring triggered by abdominal surgery. Patients with severe scar formation often require a&lt;br/&gt;follow-up surgical procedure called adhesiolysis. Adhesiolysis is performed to cut away the&lt;br/&gt;internal scars that have bridged different organs or caused intestinal obstructions. Annually,&lt;br/&gt;540,000 adhesiolysis procedures are performed in the US. These secondary surgical&lt;br/&gt;procedures can also cause additional scar formation resulting in cycles of repeat procedures.&lt;br/&gt;While current barrier products reduce the severity of internal scarring by 51%, they all degrade&lt;br/&gt;after a few weeks. Furthermore, none are approved for use during laparoscopic procedures, a&lt;br/&gt;preferred technique for adhesiolysis. Traditionally, products used for scar reduction have been&lt;br/&gt;made from materials that degrade. In contrast, the proposed device is made from a nondegrading&lt;br/&gt;material that has been safely used in the body for the past 40 years. This stronger&lt;br/&gt;material enables laparoscopic use and ensures separation of internal organs. As such, this&lt;br/&gt;proposed device has shown promising results in pilot studies and could lead to a new standard&lt;br/&gt;of care for patients at risk for severe internal scar formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to develop an implantable barrier film to reduce scar&lt;br/&gt;formation inside the body after abdominal surgery. Current conventional thinking in biomaterial&lt;br/&gt;selection for scar reducing barrier films has relied primarily on resorbable materials. However,&lt;br/&gt;these barriers do not perform well enough to be utilized in severe adhesion cases nor&lt;br/&gt;laparoscopic procedures. The implementation of a permanent barrier in this space stems from&lt;br/&gt;the development of non-resorbable synthetic meshes for the repair of abdominal and pelvic&lt;br/&gt;hernias. Furthermore, the non-degrading property of the permanent film ensures long-term&lt;br/&gt;control over the surface topography, which has been shown to play a substantial role in cell&lt;br/&gt;adhesion. The project goals are to evaluate a non-resorbable barrier that maintains an&lt;br/&gt;extremely smooth, mildly hydrophobic surface in the healing process of internal tissue surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;A twelve week definitive animal (rabbit) study utilizing an established surgical adhesion&lt;br/&gt;abdominal model will determine the efficacy of the proposed device to reduce surgical adhesion&lt;br/&gt;formation as compared to a control group and a commercially available product. If successful,&lt;br/&gt;the results will influence decisions concerning material composition for future anti-adhesion,&lt;br/&gt;anti-scarring, and other implants in addition to providing a better understanding of internal&lt;br/&gt;wound healing pathways</AbstractNarration>

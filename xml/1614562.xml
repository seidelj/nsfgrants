    <AbstractNarration>How would you measure the closeness of two signatures or two clay&lt;br/&gt;figurines? This project explores the mathematics and computation of&lt;br/&gt;measuring similarity between curves or 3-dimensional objects --&lt;br/&gt;whether to compare GPS tracking data to road maps, or medical scans of internal organs to&lt;br/&gt;reference models of healthy organs. While some well understood comparison methods simply&lt;br/&gt;look at how close the objects are, this project aims to design more&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated measures that take into account the underlying structure&lt;br/&gt;(or topology) of the curves and surfaces. The PI plans to collaborate&lt;br/&gt;with applications areas that use these measurement algorithms to&lt;br/&gt;develop measures that best fit the areas, in addition to continuing&lt;br/&gt;her work in a larger network of shape analysis and computational&lt;br/&gt;topology communities, including organizing workshops focused at&lt;br/&gt;mentoring junior women in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project generalizes notions of similarity from curves to graphs, meshes, or&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds. The primary problems and techniques come from the&lt;br/&gt;emerging field of computational topology, which combines algorithms&lt;br/&gt;and computational geometry with mathematical foundations and tools&lt;br/&gt;from the area of topology. In particular, the PI proposes to examine&lt;br/&gt;fundamental topological notions of similarity between curves and&lt;br/&gt;surfaces in some ambient space, based on computing optimal homotopies, homologies, or isotopies. Each&lt;br/&gt;possibility offers a different notion of what it means for two things&lt;br/&gt;to be equivalent in the ambient space, and each can be optimized based&lt;br/&gt;on the notions of area, "height," or "width." While several initial&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic results on these measures have been published, there are&lt;br/&gt;many open questions that remain. In addition, recent mathematical&lt;br/&gt;developments indicate many potentially tractable and feasible areas&lt;br/&gt;that are yet to be explored from the algorithmic perspective. Some of&lt;br/&gt;these measures are likely to be hard to compute, which is of interest&lt;br/&gt;to the theoretical community, and approximation or fixed parameter&lt;br/&gt;tractable algorithms may prove practical in applications areas. The&lt;br/&gt;project will also include collaborations in applications areas for&lt;br/&gt;these measures, in order to better evaluate their utility.</AbstractNarration>

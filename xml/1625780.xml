    <AbstractNarration>A magnetic field, measured in Tesla, is a fundamental physical variable, similar to pressure. As a reference, the Earth's magnetic field is of the order of 0.5mT (milli Tesla). Although X-ray diffraction at high pressures is now a common technique, X-ray diffraction and scattering techniques at steady state magnetic fields above 15 Tesla are unavailable. The new 25 Tesla Florida Split Coil Magnet provides the opportunity to change this, increasing the accessible steady-state magnetic field for X-ray studies by nearly 66%. Adding a diffraction setup to the Florida Split Coil Magnet that is located at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, will provide unique capabilities to probe the magnetic responses in crystalline materials. The instrument will facilitate structural studies in high magnetic fields for the broader research community. Examples of materials to be studied include superconductors, ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials, as well as engineering materials. An example of the latter is rolled steel, where a martensitic phase transition can be induced at low temperatures by magnetic fields in excess of 12 Tesla. The diffractometer will consist of an X-ray source, a beam delivery system, a sample holder, and an area detector. Due to the large fringe fields emanating from the magnet, it is imperative to include magnetic field mitigation in the design of the diffractometer. Electronic and mechanical components susceptible to magnetic fields need to be removed from the space where strong fringe fields are present, requiring custom built and custom modified devices and parts. To enhance the X-ray flux delivered to the sample, additional optical elements reflecting and focusing the X-ray beam, will be included. The diffractometer will become part of the user capabilities at the NHMFL, and will be available to the user community at large via the NHMFL proposal system. The instrument will be the only one of its kind, leveraging the investment of NSF in the NHMFL and the Florida Split Coil Magnet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) is at the forefront of resistive magnet technology, and holds the world record in DC magnetic field strength. The recent addition of the world's strongest split coil magnet, with 25T field strength and visual access to the sample allows the development of a novel X-ray diffractometer to study the spin-lattice coupling of materials at high fields. Spin-lattice interactions in crystalline materials where spin order or orbital order elicits an elastic response of the lattice that can be studied. Diffraction techniques are well suited to detect this elastic response via unit cell changes, with high accuracy. Additionally, a magnetic field can also induce magnetic phase transitions and magnetic order, and order temperatures can be shifted. Magnetostrictive effects are observed in a number of ferro-, antiferro-, and helimagnetic materials, as well as multiferroic materials that couple ferroelectric and ferromagnetic order via the magneto-electric effect. The diffractometer will consist of an X-ray source, a beam delivery system, a sample holder, and an area detector. Due to the large fringe fields, in excess of 0.2T, emanating from the magnet, it is imperative to include magnetic field mitigation in the design of the diffractometer. Electronic and mechanical components susceptible to magnetic fields need to be removed from the space where strong fringe fields are present, requiring custom built and custom modified devices and parts, together with passive and active magnetic field shielding. The diffractometer includes a high power rotating anode X-ray source, optical elements such as X-ray mirrors, evacuated beam paths, beryllium windows, a custom sample holder, and a modified X-ray area detector adapted to perform in the strong fringe fields at the X-ray exit port. The diffractometer will become part of the measurement capabilities at the NHMFL for the 25T split coil magnet, and will be available to the user community at large. The instrument will be the only one of its kind, leveraging the investment of NSF in the NHMFL and the Florida Split Coil Magnet. This system will complement the pulsed magnets at national synchrotron light sources, and it increases the available DC field strength for diffraction experiments. Development of the instrument is an excellent opportunity to train a student and postdoc in the construction and integration of components, building an instrument with unique capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

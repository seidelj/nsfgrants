<AbstractNarration>This award supports graduate and undergraduate students studying at US institutions to participate in the 31st Annual Meeting of the American Society for Precision Engineering. This gathering will be held October 23-27, 2016, in Portland, Oregon. The award provides student participants with opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide industrial and governmental facilities, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international schools. As the Annual Meeting of the American Society for Precision Engineering is considered a globally-leading professional gathering in the precision engineering area; hence, in addition to nurturing a global manufacturing vision, participants will learn the latest results and innovations in these fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support will cover the full registration fees for up to 66 students. The call for student support applications is disseminated through posting on main conference website, promulgation through conference organizers, and direct communication with students involved in poster session. The submitted applications go through a selection process by the conference committee. The eligibility criteria to receive the funding include (1) students must be from US institutions and (2) students must be actively participating in the conference through presenting a paper or a poster. The two highest selection ranks are given to students who have multiple technical papers accepted and students who present NSF-sponsored technical papers. After the conference, the list of student awardees will be announced on the main conference website and in the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Precision Engineering post-conference report.</AbstractNarration>

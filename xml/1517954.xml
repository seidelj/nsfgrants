    <AbstractNarration>The aim of the proposal is to conduct cutting-edge simulations of Abell 2146, which consists of two merging, massive galaxy clusters that are viewed close to the plane of the sky soon after their first collision. Dark matter dominates the merger's total mass, and its distribution has been revealed. The normal baryonic matter in the merger is hot, and its distribution is known from X-ray measurements. Due to the merger's favorable viewing angle and youth, these distributions differ markedly. This provides a rare opportunity to use the proposed simulations to place strong constraints on the merger's material and dynamics. As an added bonus, the simulations will investigate why this cluster merger lacks radio emission, in stark contrast to its ubiquity in other mergers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue her established efforts to recruit local high school students from underrepresented groups into her institution. She will also develop a series of software-tools workshops for students and faculty at her institution.</AbstractNarration>

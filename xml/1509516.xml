    <AbstractNarration>Optimal control methods provide a means to associate a user-defined cost with control actions or decisions. These methods have made pervasive impacts in a wide class of application domains. The shift towards autonomy by the automotive industry in examples such as replacing mechanical systems with computer controlled electronic control systems, has resulted in efficiencies in fuel injection, braking, throttling, etc. For electric vehicles, fuel economy, drivability, and emission control are functions of the engine design and the control strategies. For robotic systems, the desire to achieve optimal behavior is essential for efficient task execution. Likewise, aerospace systems have always been a mainstream application domain for optimal control methods because there has always been (and always will be) a tight coupling between performance and energy/fuel costs. As the cost of energy and the awareness of the environmental impacts of producing energy have risen, optimal control may now play a timely role in a broader spectrum of application domains. The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office of the U.S. Department of Energy indicates that as much as 10-20 percent of American energy use could be saved by optimizing industrial systems. It is self-evident that optimal control solutions can have significant impacts in a wide range of industries, but the development of optimal control solutions for real engineering systems is limited by numerous technical barriers. The most fundamental and open-ended problems arise from barriers associated with developing optimal solutions in the presence of uncertainty. The driving question in this project is how to arbitrate between gaining knowledge about a system while simultaneously making the optimal control decision for engineering systems that are uncertain and complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical aims of this project are motivated by the hypothesis and observations from preliminary efforts that nonlinear analysis methods can be exploited to design real-time approximate optimal solutions, while concurrent background processing methods can be used to update the optimal control approximation for improved performance. Intellectual merits in this project are realized through the development of classes of closed-loop controllers with associated stability analysis, and advanced function approximation methods, that ensure sufficient exploration of the system response while learning the approximate optimal control solution. Outcomes of this research would allow for optimal control implementation in a broader class of application domains where the system exhibits nonlinear behaviors and uncertainty. The broad impact of this framework is a merger of methods that bridge the gap between the computational intelligence community and control systems community to enable data-based learning methods to optimize control performance.</AbstractNarration>

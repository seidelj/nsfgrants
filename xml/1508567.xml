    <AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Eric Borguet of Temple University designs and performs experiments to investigate the characteristics of single molecules with a particular focus on the effect of external physical and chemical parameters on changing the electrical resistance. To meet this challenge, target molecules whose properties depend on their immediate surroundings are investigated with state-of-the-art techniques. This research advances our understanding of the electrical properties of molecular components of sensors and electrical devices. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of single molecule sensors and switches which can help to miniaturize electronic devices as well as the education and development of a diverse scientific workforce trained in a multidisciplinary environment. In addition, by providing participants from the diverse student body of Temple University that includes underrepresented minorities and first generation college students, and allowing local high school students the opportunity to engage in this research, the preparation of the next generation of scientists is advanced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the use of scanning tunneling microscopes to create nanoscale junctions that can trap single molecules for electrical measurements. Specifically selected probe molecules, whose electronic properties are sensitive to the characteristics of the environment in which they are located, are investigated. In addition, molecules are oriented in the measurement junction to determine the anisotropy of the electrical properties of the molecules.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Title: Student Mentoring Workshop at ICFP 2015&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Student Mentoring Workshop is being organized as part of the 20th International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), one of the premier conferences in the area of programming languages. The conference will be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This grant will support approximately 15 students to attend the mentoring workshop plus the ICFP conference. This proposal is intended specifically to target women students and students from underrepresented groups and gives priority to US citizens and permanent residents. The broader significance and importance of the grant relate to the need to broaden participation, provide opportunities for students to receive mentoring from leading members of the programming languages community, and build the next generation of researchers and knowledgeable practitioners in this important research arena.</AbstractNarration>

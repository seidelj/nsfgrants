    <AbstractNarration>Universities have established technology transfer offices (TTOs) to manage the commercialization of intellectual property arising from federally-funded research. Faculty members who patent, license, or form a new company based on this intellectual property are directed to work through the university TTO, a process of formal technology transfer. However, some academic scientists choose to circumvent or bypass the university TTO and engage in informal technology transfer. The objective of this project is to obtain new evidence on the determinants of informal technology transfer. It provides useful insights for university administrators and policymakers who govern universities. An understanding of what induces informal technology transfer can help institutions adopt effective policies to support academic entrepreneurship and also develop an organizational climate that is more conducive to formal technology transfer. The project has further important implications for initiatives designed to stimulate startup formation by faculty and student entrepreneurs, such as the NSF I-Corps program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses key limitations of prior studies of academic. The focus is the individual faculty member, who is the source of innovation and potential entrepreneurship. This research examines key psychological variables that are relevant to individuals and the decision to work with the university TTO. Specifically, we examine efforts on the part of TTOs to educate faculty regarding academic entrepreneurship, championing behavior by university administrators (e.g., university presidents who are especially enthusiastic about academic entrepreneurship), and faculty perceptions of fairness and equity (i.e., organizational justice). This is the first study to apply principles of organizational justice to university technology transfer. We use both quantitative and qualitative methods. We conduct several detailed case studies, and more broadly, survey faculty members at 35 universities. The combined use of data on individuals, academic departments, universities, and the surrounding regions of sampled universities, enables a comprehensive perspective on informal technology transfer.</AbstractNarration>

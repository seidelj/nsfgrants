    <AbstractNarration>The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) field campaign was a (May-Jun) 2012 experiment to study the impact of deep, mid-latitude continental convective systems, including their dynamical, physical, and lightning production processes, along with the regional consequences for upper tropospheric (UT) composition and chemistry. The campaign consisted of ground-based observations in Colorado, Oklahoma, and Alabama, as well as in situ and remotely sensed sampling of the outflow and inflow of the convective storms observed from the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V (GV) and NASA DC-8 research aircraft. This proposal seeks further analysis and modeling of the chemistry associated with specific storms observed in the DC3 project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focused efforts include use of the DC3 observations to improve model representation of lightning flash rates along with the horizontal and vertical placement of lightning produced nitrogen oxide (LNOx) production, as well as the estimation of the magnitude of LNOx production. In addition, the convective transport of pollutants from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere in these storms will be investigated in models, as well as downward (intrusion)&lt;br/&gt;transport of stratospheric ozone.</AbstractNarration>

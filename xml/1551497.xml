    <AbstractNarration>This project supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) and Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE:EHR) programs will conduct a workshop to begin development of educational video materials documenting how modern silicon-based microelectronic integrated circuits are produced. The project will be led by Silicon Run Productions of Mountain View, California. The eventual goal of the effort is video material that can be used by educators for the benefit of students at all levels with particular emphasis on undergraduate science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science students and the education of the general public. Silicon-based technology is vital to nearly all consumer products as well as the many industries that support the semiconductor infrastructure. Silicon-based integrated circuit (IC) microfabrication is also central to emerging technological products such as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) that incorporate IC processes or utilize hybrid formats. Gaining access to state-of-the-art industrial microfabrication sites is problematic due to cleanroom and competitive issues. The project has been able to enlist cooperation of a silicon-based nanotechnology integrated circuit facility for the purposes of developing and filming documentary material. With otherwise little access to such facilities, the intended educational video will provide students with a real-world look at industrial integrated circuit manufacturing upon which modern electronics such as mobile phones rely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nanoelectronics video will feature the most advanced manufacturing processes used to make todays planar and three-dimensional semiconductor devices. This project will begin the pre-production phases of the activity and conduct a workshop with educators and industry. The workshop focus will be to review the existing material and explore the possible role and content of the video so it can best serve students and an engaged general public. With input from the workshop, a tentative script will be written to serve as a basis for preliminary work in the microfabrication facility. The project has a unique opportunity to document a modern 300 mm wafer manufacturing line that specializes in nanoelectronics and sub-22 nm process technology. This phase of the Nanoelectronics video project will provide the first steps toward a high-quality documentary treatment of a vital area in modern technology resulting in a long-needed update to current semiconductor processing videos. The work is expected to have a broad impact on the education and training of technicians, engineers, scientists and the education of the general public.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The explosion in American oil-and-gas production, made possible by "fracking" technologies and high prices, has drawn significant attention to government regulation. There is also an enormous private-law side of the energy boom. Property rights -- both to the land (surface rights) and to the oil and gas underneath (mineral rights)-- are required to get oil and gas from the underground to markets. This project studies how the industry acquires property rights in the oil-and-gas booming (and busting) states of North Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana. These rights are extremely fractured, so land acquisition needed to install a single well or pipeline can involve hundreds or thousands of individuals, companies, and governments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is on the people who make deals to lease and buy property, and compensate for damages: "landmen," brokers paid by energy companies; mineral and surface owners and renters; and attorneys. This project will use ethnographic observation and interviews, supplemented by archival and quantitative analysis, to find out how brokers, mineral and surface owners, and third parties&lt;br/&gt;secure or prevent property deals (mineral leases, mineral sales, and right-of-way and other surface agreements), how they define fairness, and how they attempt to change the rules to accommodate these transactions.</AbstractNarration>

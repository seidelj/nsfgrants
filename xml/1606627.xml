    <AbstractNarration>1606627&lt;br/&gt;Herrmann&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In March 2014, an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola virus disease began in Western Africa. The Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response requested that the Institute of Medicine establish a rapid and agile process for convening subject matter experts to address adverse health effects of medical and public health emergencies and disasters when they occur. The goal of the process is to prioritize scientific research needs in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. This will culminate in a summary report of the strategic science questions most relevant to promote a better response, recovery, or enhanced resilience in the affected community. Environmental engineers and scientists play an important role in disaster response as noted is several recent situations such as the Elk River (Charleston, West Virginia) chemical spill, the Dan River (North Carolina) coal ash spill, and the lead and microbiological contaminated drinking water in the Flint River (Flint, Michigan).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Institute of Medicine will convene an ad-hoc committee whose composition would vary based on the nature of the emergency/disaster. The committee could include experts in public health, epidemiology, environmental health, first responders, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, nursing, emergency management, bioethics, medical countermeasures, state and local government, operations research national civic organizations, and risk communication. The process convened by the Institute of Medicine would also provide a connection to the local communities affected by the disaster by including important stakeholders such as non-government funders or other organizations. The committee will identify fast track-activities required to assist with evolving public health emergencies and disasters. The process will provide a venue for on-going communication among the medical and public health communities, as well as other relevant stakeholders involved in planning and response activities. The Institute of Medicine would assist in the planning and development of related ad hoc activities undertaken by separately appointed committees as appropriate. The process would be triggered by a large scale disaster event, at the request of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, and may be initiated in the affected locality. In addition, the committee will formulate a strategic report of scientific priorities, gaps, recommended prospective studies, or recommended or required administrative infrastructural support of such science. Further, as needed, the standing committee will be involved in the planning, development, and oversight of related fast-track ad hoc activities undertaken by separately appointed committees operating under its auspices that will be able to help prioritize scientific research needs during a public health event or in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. The Standing Committee on Medical and Public Health Research During Large-Scale Emergency Events will coordinate with units across the National Academies to provide a venue for discussion of issues related to short- and long-term strategic planning. The committee will provide a venue for a dialog between the federal, state, and local governments, the private sector, academic community, other research funders, as well as other relevant stakeholders involved in emergency preparedness and emergency response services.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>While data analytics for business and entertainment have become well established, the application of data analytics to education needs research and development. Educational innovation does not have the driving force of economics generating evolutionary responses to societal and technological change, yet data-informed instructional methods offer tremendous promise for transforming American teaching, learning, and schooling. Beyond the potential to enhance student outcomes through just-in-time, diagnostic data that is formative for learning and instruction, educational improvements could be substantially accelerated through data-intensive research fostering rapid cycles of innovation. This award is for a workshop bringing together education researchers from industry, non-profits, academe, and government to address issues in data intensive research ranging from learning analytics to ethics and privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop, the second in a series of two, will focus on applying heuristics from the sciences and engineering to articulate in education the conditions for success and models for effective partnerships in data intensive research. Following the workshop, the results will be published in a formal volume based on the workshop outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

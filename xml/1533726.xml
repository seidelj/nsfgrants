    <AbstractNarration>This award is intended to provide travel support to the essential representatives of the US scientific community who serve as the US members of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) working groups or standing committees and to the US delegate to IASC to participate in activities associated with Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW) 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US representatives will participate in the Arctic Science Summit Week and associated meetings in Toyama, Japan on April 23 - 30, 2015. This award includes support for: a) PI Hinzman, the US delegate to IASC, to participate on behalf of the US Arctic science community on the IASC Council; b) travel support for US representatives to each of the five working groups appointed through the US National Academies process; and c) travel support for US representatives of the IASC?s Data Standing Committee. The US representative to the SAON Observations and Networks Committee should also participate in this meeting with funds provided through this award. IASC facilitates international science development through workshop, networks, planning meetings, and early-career science support. It promotes and facilitates international research activities with an emphasis on issues that not only cross national boundaries, but also cross disciplines and even timescales. National support is essential to ensure the US maintains a leadership role in planning and coordinating these research efforts in the international sphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an important part of the US contribution to this international effort and the Arctic Section finds the plan fits well with section goals. Staff recommends an award at the requested amount.</AbstractNarration>

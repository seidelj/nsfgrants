    <AbstractNarration>The Institute for Systems Research (ISR), at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park, will organize an International Symposium on Networked Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) together with the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany. This first symposium of its kind in the new and emerging area of Networked CPS is to be held at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) tentatively on September 19-20, 2016. The plan is to have this Symposium on an annual basis, with the location alternating each year between TUM, Munich, and UMD, College Park. This symposium will aim at the establishment of collaboration in the new area of Networked CPS at an international level. The broader societal impact of the proposed effort is likely to be high due to its strong relevance to a new generation of industry, namely exploiting the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The training, education, and workforce development involving under-represented groups are going to play a critical role in this new development and will be discussed as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this workshop, the critical research challenges will be identified by world renowned researchers from several countries (USA, Germany, England, Switzerland, Greece, and The Netherlands), who are experts in a variety of fields related to the interdisciplinary area of Networked CPS. The workshop will also aim to explore the intellectual underpinnings of a highly important and emerging area, potentially having great global and technological impact due to its strong relevance to a new generation of industry, namely involving the so called the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The results of the workshop will be made available to the public in the form of a report. Requested funds will be used primarily to cover the expenses of plenary and invited speakers and researchers from the USA.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This infrastructure proposal supports the acquisition of a multi-robot team suited for operations&lt;br/&gt;in coastal environments. The robot team consists of two underwater vehicles (AUVs), three&lt;br/&gt;surface vehicles (ASVs), as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): two fixed-wing UAVs and&lt;br/&gt;two quadrocopters. The target domain is the coastal waters of South Carolina. In several applications&lt;br/&gt;such as environmental monitoring, homeland security, resource utilization, and contamination&lt;br/&gt;tracking, there is a need to track a mass of water, record a set of properties, such as salinity,&lt;br/&gt;temperature, presence of different substances, and also record the position and boundaries&lt;br/&gt;of the said body. The proposed infrastructure will enable computing research for addressing&lt;br/&gt;the above problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project revolves around enabling research on several CISE research&lt;br/&gt;fields at the University of South Carolina, including algorithmic development for multi-robot&lt;br/&gt;coordination, path-planning and state estimation; planning under uncertainty; sensor fusion&lt;br/&gt;from different modalities; and human-robot interaction.</AbstractNarration>

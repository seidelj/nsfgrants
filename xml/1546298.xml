    <AbstractNarration>This award uses funds, under the auspices of the EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, for a project aimed at establishing a Uranium-Thorium based age model for stalagmites from Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia, generating preliminary proxy data, and calibrating environmental proxies against drip water chemistry from caves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall science goal is to use the results of this research to help improve the understanding of mid-latitude hydroclimate response to rapid climate changes on a variety of timescales. The project also has an educational goal of providing training for two Hispanic-American undergraduate students who are already working in the researcher's lab as research assistants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, project funds will support several analyses such as cave drip water chemistry, trace elements, fluorescence emission and intensity, delta 18-Oxygen and delta 13-Carbon, and stalagmite carbonate mineralogy as well as development of a U-Th based age model and the collection of cave drip waters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project activities fit well into the potentially transformative, high-risk, and exploratory nature of the EAGER program because they are inherently interdisciplinary and rely on untested ideas and techniques. The analytical activities of the study are novel and thus would likely not fare well in the regular merit review process, especially without some preliminary data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project could have a significant impact on the field of paleoclimatology by providing a chronology and time series from a new natural data archive in an area sensitive to hydrologic change on varying timescales. The project could lead to novel and transformative ways to explore hydroclimate studies in collaboration with other science disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

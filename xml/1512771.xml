    <AbstractNarration>1512214 / Egolfopoulos, Fokion N.&lt;br/&gt;1512771 / Blanquart, Guillaume&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigators propose to investigate how fluid flows (typical in devices such as combustor in engines and power plants) can be better modelled by using the state-of-art computer simulation techniques with the help of advanced laser-based measurements. The potential benefits of the study include better understanding and design of combustors and higher efficiency and lower pollutant emissions. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research and be prepared as future researchers and engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on fundamental investigation of the effects of heat release on small scale turbulent structure and aims to provide insight and mechanisms for developing physics-based turbulent reacting models, rather than based on ad-hoc assumptions. The experimental components include novel velocity measurements, adopting an approach similar to tomography in that the velocity measurements cover the depth of the field instead of the traditional two-dimensional section in truly three-dimensional flows. Some insight will also be shed on whether Kolmogorov's equilibrium assumption for turbulent kinetic energy cascade is valid and, if not, to what extent and in what manner the assumption should be modified by the heat-releasing reactions. The measurements span over a broader dynamic range of scales than is normally addressed using PIV. The proposed direct numerical simulations (DNS) and analysis are well focused on questions of the effects of heat release on turbulent energy spectra and energy transfer between different scales.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has. One technique for exploring physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is in making precision measurements of SM model atomic parameters such as the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. This award will develop the accelerator technology necessary for such a precision measurement of the neutron EDM. This project is to explore essential tools for exploration of physics beyond Standard model of particle physics. Tools for this exploration include a neutron beam storage ring, polarized proton beams and high power beams. Besides the basic physics, high power beams can be important to "nuclear waste" incineration, which can be important to national security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow the study of synchro-betatron coupling of polarized beams relevant to the measurement of EDM, continuing exploration of a neutron beam storage ring, and envelope dynamics of high power proton accelerators. The group will study spin dynamics and synchrotron-betatron coupling of all electric rings that are relevant to polarized beams and will continue to study the neutron beam storage ring. The longitudinal focusing of longitudinal phase space has been explored. The transverse dynamics in using periodic quadrupole and sextupole magnets will be explored to fulfill the initial design of a storage ring. TEST beam experiments will be carried out to test numerical simulations for high power beams.</AbstractNarration>

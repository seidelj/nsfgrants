    <AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting the four-day 23th edition of the GENI Engineering Conference (GEC), including organizing and hosting the demo session, to be held June 15-18, 2015, on the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign campus. The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI is an instrument designed to address three issues:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Science Issues: We cannot currently understand or predict the behavior of complex, large-scale networks;&lt;br/&gt;2) Society Issues: We increasingly rely on the Internet but are unsure we can trust its security, privacy or resilience; and&lt;br/&gt;3) Innovation Issues: Pre-GENI substantial barriers existed to at-scale experimentation with new architectures, services, and technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENI addresses these issues via scale (from federation) and support for two kinds of experiments: 1) controlled and repeatable experiments, which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks; and 2) in-the-wild trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today's Internet and that engage large numbers of human participants. The GEC meeting and Demo sessions provide graduate students with both an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research; this project supports further development and use of the research instrument.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corp L), this project will help train teachers and faculty on the use of current technologies in microprocessor/microcontroller related embedded system designs. The microelectronics embedded into everyday technologies has changed daily life dramatically. However it is challenging for educators in the field of microelectronics and embedded systems to keep up with the fast pace of changing technology and ensure that engineering students are learning to design with currently-relevant microcontroller products. The project will address faculty professional development in embedded system hardware and software. An emphasis will be placed on implementation of delivery in a variety of formats to address the needs of potential users. This project focuses on training faculty in academic communities on up-to-date technologies in microprocessor/microcontroller relevant to modern industry practice. These efforts will enable future educated students to apply microelectronic concepts in designing intelligent products and ehance the capabilities of the nation's workforce. This effort will contribute to maintaining the United States' leadership in the area of microcontroller technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The features of this embedded system educational program include system training, control software codes, course curricula, laboratory activities, application projects, step-by-step guides, demonstration videos, and recorded training classes. The curriculum includes 16 different course modules ranging from beginning to more advanced projects. Supporting materials assist users in understanding the basic concepts and in designing applied engineering projects. The development is based on input and feedback from faculty, students, consultants, and industry. Project features are optimized to provide flexibility in applications of importance to educators striving to expose students to a variety of embedded system uses. The electronic hardware components used emphasize durability, ease of maintenance, and upgrade compatibility. This I-Corps L Team is composed of faculty from Old Dominion University and Ohio Northern University as well as an industry expert from Auto-Sign Incorporated.</AbstractNarration>

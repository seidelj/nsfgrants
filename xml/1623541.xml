<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin will host a conference for new researchers in statistics and probability from July 28-30, 2016. (See http://www.stat.wisc.edu/imsnrc18/index.html.) The meeting is organized by the IMS Committee on New Researchers and held for junior researchers working in different areas of Statistics and Probability. The primary objective of the conference is to provide a much needed platform for interaction among new researchers, as well as opportunities to seek mentorship from leading researchers in the field. This conference series is explicitly aimed at training the future leaders and researchers in probability and statistics. This award provides partial funding for the 2016 conference, as well as for the 2017 and 2018 conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Committee on New Researchers of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics will hold its 2016 conference at the University of Wisconsin, July 28-30, 2016. Each participant will give a brief introduction to his/her research, as well as a poster presentation. Plenary talks will be given by established researchers. There will be panel discussions on teaching and mentoring, publishing, funding, and finding collaborators. NSF is providing funding to partially support this conference for the next three years.</AbstractNarration>

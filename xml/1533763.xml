    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The proposed Bridging Alliances to Infuse Neuroscience at The Lincoln University (BrainLU) Targeted Infusion project aims to establish a neuroscience program in the Department of Biology at Lincoln University. This project seeks to diversify the pipeline of neuroscientists for the 21st century. BrainLU will train undergraduate students to think like scientists and immerse them in innovative research so that they can contribute to the advancement of neuroscience. The project is transformative as it brings an interdisciplinary approach to teaching undergraduate neuroscience and transitions undergraduate students to graduate education with high-impact learning experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To attain the goal of establishing a neuroscience program, the following objectives will be carried out over the 3-year funding period: 1) train and engage underrepresented undergraduate students in innovative neuroscience research in the research laboratory and classroom; 2) establish an interdisciplinary major in neuroscience at The Lincoln University that fosters creativity and original thought and builds critical thinking, analytical, quantitative, and research skills; and 3) develop a dynamic cooperative 4+1 BS/MS program in neuroscience between Lincoln University and Drexel University College of Medicine that can lead to a PhD in neuroscience. The proposed activities are geared to excite students about cutting-edge neuroscience research, bridge collaborating partners, and leverage the existing NSF HBCU-UP LEAPS Forward March program.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this three year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program, Summer Engineering Research Experiences in Power and Energy Systems for Smart Cities, at the University of Denver, is to promote undergraduate research in response to ongoing challenges in development of Smart Grids and Smart Cities and to address the growing need for a well-trained and knowledgeable workforce with expertise on smart power and energy systems. Each year, a cohort of undergraduate students will be recruited to participate in summer research in Power and Energy Systems for Smart Cities at the University of Denver. Faculty members and senior researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) will mentor these undergraduate research students. The outcome of the project will be a knowledgeable and trained workforce which would act as the next generation of engineers and thought leaders for ensuring a successful movement toward smart urban environments and addressing the prevailing challenges of energy, economy, and environment. The project team will reach out to a broader range of students with a focus on minority and underrepresented groups, and predominantly undergraduate institutions. The proposed research is expected to significantly enhance the design of future electric power grids via educating the next generation of engineers and leaders in the energy sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Denver will host a 9-week summer program which will advance research training for 10 undergraduate students in the area of Smart Cities with a focus on electricity infrastructure. Selected projects, including transportation electrification, electric power resiliency, energy economy, community microgrids, data analytics, and renewable energy deployment will provide students with a comprehensive exposure to current and future challenges in achieving a reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity supply and delivery system, and further offer the required groundwork in cross-disciplinary research on smart urban environments. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in that the research and educational activities will benefit students in power and energy systems, and further provide them with a basic understanding of related topics of economics, decision theory, and mathematical optimization. In addition to revitalizing traditional power and energy systems curricula, the project team also plans to introduce a new special-topic course on Smart Urban Environments. The theoretical and practical implications of the developed results will equip undergraduate students, not only in the REU site but also in a wider geographical area via planned outreach and dissemination activities. The REU experience will improve research skills of undergraduates and encourage them to pursue graduate studies in STEM fields and further contribute to the U.S. energy independence and national security.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the workshop is to map out a roadmap of the evolution and potential breakthroughs in the area of quantum information on a chip for the coming years. It will identify the most promising area of technology where quantum phenomena are expected to play an important role for various applications. An important portion of the workshop will be centered on breakaway sessions to discuss anticipated progress in the areas of quantum communication, sensing, imaging, and computing. Also, breakaway sessions will be focused on required technology advances in single photon sources, integration, atoms/ions-on-a-chip, quantum-dot on-a-chip, and color-centers on-a-chip. A final joint session will summarize the results from the different breakout teams and summarize recommendations for future research. This Workshop will gather some of the leading US and European experts in quantum photonics and facilitate cross-pollination of ideas that will impact future science and technology. This conference will cover a wide range of multidisciplinary topics related to quantum information on a chip. It will open up new directions for research that will leverage out the infrastructure in the area of nanophotonic integration.</AbstractNarration>

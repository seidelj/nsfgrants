    <AbstractNarration>This research will contribute to a growing body of work concerned with the genetic basis of adaptation. Adaptation to local environments is important for persistence under a changing climate; however, remarkably little is known about the genetic mechanisms by which it occurs. This work will examine the genetic underpinnings of local adaptation in a perennial plant species with two well-studied, putatively adaptive genes that are associated with chemical defense against herbivores. The researchers focus on white clover, an important grazing crop. The research promotes collaborations between three U.S. research institutions and a New Zealand agricultural research institute. It also builds upon the previously established Clover Project, which has provided instructional materials to &gt; 70 teachers and 6000+ students nationwide. This project helps train an underrepresented minority student and will provide independent, complementary projects for 6+ undergraduate students. Because the focal plant species is an important agricultural crop worldwide, the development of genetic resources will be useful for breeders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will examine the genetic underpinnings of local adaptation in white clover (Trifolium repens L.). For two years, reproductive output will be measured for cloned plants grown in reciprocal common gardens across three climatically distinct sites. QTL mapping of fitness measurements will characterize the genetic architecture of local adaptation. Research will determine the distribution of effect sizes of locally adaptive genes and the extent that adaptation is caused by either conditionally neutral alleles or ones that show antagonistic pleiotropy. Overall the work will provide a genome-wide assessment of the importance of cyanogenesis.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a small set of pioneering applications that teach science in awe-inspiring holographic 3D space. Students will put on their holographic glasses and explore fundamental scientific concepts and phenomena in unparalleled ways. For example, learners will be able to touch elusive subatomic particles in holographic 3D, dissect living cells to observe cellular processes, dive into the incredibly hot core of massive stars to witness the creation of heavy elements during thermonuclear fusion, or explore what happens when two galaxies collide. The project could take science education to the next level because it will trigger the much needed ?Aha!" moments in science classrooms as learners go to impossible places where no book or teacher could ever take them, and explore concepts and phenomena that are difficult to grasp in any other way. The project is envisioned to contribute significantly to science education nationwide while creating numerous hi-tech jobs and generating tax revenue. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one the first projects that will develop holographic applications specifically for science education. The final result of the project will be a set of mixed-reality holographic 3D applications that lets students explore and understand scientific concepts and phenomena and help them overcome stubborn misconceptions in science. Intelligent avatars will guide students through thought-provoking scientific explorations and continuously assess their learning. Students can interact with the avatar in natural ways: by manipulating objects in the virtual environment or by clicking buttons and constructing sentences. In teacher-guided mode the avatar can be turned off and the teacher can lead the exploration. Stunning visuals will make the experience unforgettable for learners while educators receive detailed visual reports on each student's progress. The efficacy and the explaining power of the holographic environment will be assessed in rigorous controlled trials. The project is envisioned to generate a significant amount of intellectual property as key components of the system will be protected by patents and all 3D models and storylines will be protected by copyright. This creates significant barriers for any competitor trying to penetrate our market or emulate our technology.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Protons and neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei, are made up of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons, whose interactions are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This theory suggests that many other types of composite particles, known as hadrons, should exist in Nature as unstable resonances. The properties of excited hadronic resonances as predicted by QCD will be investigated. Exotic particles, such as glueballs, hybrid mesons, and tetraquarks are of particular interest. The proposed research lends support to current experiments, such as in the Hall B N* program and the GlueX experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), which are studying such hadronic resonances. Hadron scattering will also be investigated. These computations rely heavily on resources provided by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by the NSF. The proposed research incorporates the participation of a graduate student whose education will be enhanced not only by involvement in scientific projects at the forefront of nuclear theory, but also with high-technology training in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physics of excited hadrons will be studied using Monte Carlo estimates of path integrals involving quark and gluon fields on a space-time lattice. In addition to conventional mesons and baryons, glueballs and so-called hybrid mesons and baryons in which the valence quarks are bound by an excited gluon field will be investigated. Exotic interpolating operators, including tetraquark operators, will be used to explore the nature of the excited states in quantum chromodynamics. Pion-pion, kaon-pion, and nucleon-pion scattering phase shifts will be computed and used to determine the decay widths of various resonances, such as the rho meson and the Roper and Lambda(1405) resonances. A new methodology for dealing with multi-hadron operators, known as the stochastic LapH method, will be used for these calculations. The newly discovered XYZ mesons, whose constituents are believed to consist of a heavy quark and antiquark plus a light quark and antiquark, will be studied using both conventional lattice QCD techniques and using a Born-Oppenheimer treatment.</AbstractNarration>

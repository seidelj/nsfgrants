    <AbstractNarration>This research project examines how coastal foragers organized their domestic practices, strategies for food collection, and the production of crafted goods in the context of a changing regional political landscape. Archaeological research provides a unique and valuable perspective on organizational variation in human societies because of its time depth and ability to access past social and ecological conditions. Hunter-gatherers throughout time have maintained extremely variable forms of political, economic, and social organization, but their means of acquiring and managing surplus and social authority may differ from agricultural societies. Some non-agricultural groups maintained institutional differences in wealth, rank, and authority; others utilized cooperative efforts, temporary leadership, or ritual practice to undertake feats like constructing impressive monumental works or establishing trade networks for specialized artisan products. This project focuses on a particular case of complex coastal hunter-gatherer development in order to contribute to the broader topic of organizational variation among foragers. In addition to extensive and ongoing educational and public outreach, this project will also contribute a detailed, contextualized record of plant and animal remains that may provide valuable data for future studies of coastal and estuary environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan doctoral student Christina Sampson, supervised by Dr. Robin Beck, will investigate the community organization of fisher-hunter-gatherers living on Weeden Island on Florida's Gulf Coast in late prehistory. This project will provide unprecedented extensive and systematically-collected data from domestic deposits. The culture area was located between complex agricultural Mississippian groups to the north and complex hunter-gatherer Calusa polities to the south. This position would have afforded opportunities for trade, competition, and the exchange and development of new ideas. The project's research questions are focused on four topics: (1) the social scale of domestic practices, (2) the tempo of occupation, (3) the extent of local authority over subsistence practices, and (4) the extent of inter-regional interaction. This project will use materials from the investigator's recent excavations at the Weeden Island site to generate data including AMS radiocarbon dates, the types and distributions of animal and plant foods consumed on site, and the attributes and locations of artifacts related to trade and craft production.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This research project will examine the processes underlying the origins and geography of language diversity in North America.  Hundreds of languages are spoken on the continent besides English, French, and Spanish, and these languages are unevenly distributed, with far more diversity in some places than others.  Although this language diversity is well documented and fundamentally affects how humans communicate, relatively little is known about the processes that have shaped the geographic patterns of language diversity.  The investigators will refine a new simulation modeling approach to provide new understanding regarding the degree to which different social and environmental processes have influenced language diversity patterns over the last 10,000 years.  The methods the project will use will provide new tools for larger-scale and longer-term contributions to the discovery of processes that influence multiple facets of cultural diversity across the planet.  The investigators will map North American language diversity and produce an open-access resource for the researchers, educators, students, and the public.  The project will further enhance an international and interdisciplinary network of researchers and will increase the utility of a global, open-access database created to enable studies of cultural and linguistic diversity.  The project also will provide interdisciplinary education and training opportunities for a diverse set of undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why do humans collectively speak so many languages, and why is the geographic distribution of these languages so uneven?  Dating back centuries, researchers from many disciplines have debated the degree to which different sociocultural, environmental, and geographic factors have shaped linguistic diversity, but the few tests of these hypotheses have failed to reach consensus due to methodological limitations, including inadequacies in multivariate analytic approaches, the failure to account for non-independence of societies due to spatial proximity and common ancestry, and inadequate attention to complex webs of causal factors and to spatial and temporal dynamics of diversification and extinction.  Previous research also has relied largely on correlation-based analyses, which imply only associations and cannot determine the mechanisms that lead to diversity patterns.  The investigators undertaking this project have pioneered the use of process-based simulation modeling in biogeography to overcome the prior methodological limitations.  They will build on experience gained during those activities to use recent modeling advances to conduct tests of long-standing and competing hypotheses from multiple disciplines regarding the geography of language diversity.  Previous work employing this approach enhanced understanding of how rainfall and demography shaped language diversity patterns in Australia.  By expanding their attention to North America, the investigators expect to provide new insights into the social, cultural, historical, and environmental processes that influence many facets of cultural diversity in different locales across the planet.</AbstractNarration>

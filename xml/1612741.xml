    <AbstractNarration>The Fluid Earth Viewer (FEVer), an interactive and visually appealing web application that will allow users to visualize current and past conditions of our planet's atmosphere and oceans will be built via this award. This free web application, available to anyone with an internet connection, will directly impact approximately 2,000 individuals in-person through three field tests and is expected to reach many more online. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FEVer will be an extension of an existing open-source web application, and the PIs will add polar data sets, extended options in the user interface, and the ability to view historical climate/weather data to the existing "earth" app. It will be a vehicle of modern Earth science communication, making information most often used by the scientific community accessible and engaging to broader communities. In particular, it will provide hands-on visualization of the important climatic role of the polar-regions, their connections to lower latitudes, and the changes they are undergoing. A companion website, FEVer-Ed, will provide background, educational support, and opportunities for additional learning through a gallery of historically interesting atmospheric and oceanic events. FEVer will serve as a gateway to data sets that have otherwise been inaccessible to audiences outside of the research community. While a number of large data sets are included in this proposal (regional and global operational weather models/reanalyses), the platform is scalable to include other data such as ice sheet and glacier dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is partially funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.</AbstractNarration>

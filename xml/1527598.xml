    <AbstractNarration>Due to the increasing demand on wireless spectrum and empowered by continued improvements in circuit technology, the performance limits of wireless networks as well as methods that hold the promise of approaching these limits remain a vital topic of inquiry. Many of the advanced techniques in wireless communication are increasingly dependent on the knowledge of link qualities (channel state information) being acquired and properly exchanged among the nodes. This task is closely dependent on how rapidly the corresponding channel gains vary (coherence intervals). Link coherence intervals may easily be different due to variations in node speeds or differences in scattering environment, but a fundamental characterization of the performance limits of networks under link coherence disparity has not been available thus far. This project exploits additional degrees of freedom that coherency disparity exposes, thus increasing spectral efficiency in wireless communication networks. The research plan is tightly coupled with educational outreach activities that seek to foster inclusiveness in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project initiates a fundamental study of the effects of coherence disparity on wireless networks, addressing prototype building blocks of wireless networks, their performance limits under coherence disparity, and efficient methods of capturing gains in this scenario. The project has the following main components: (1) Study of broadcast channels and multiple-access channels under coherence disparity, including multi-user extensions and outer bounds; (2) Study of frequency-selective channels and orthogonal frequency-division multiplex (OFDM) resource reuse under coherence disparity; and (3) Study of relay and cooperative networks under coherence disparity.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The Conference on the Intersection of Particle and Nuclear Physics (CIPANP) is a triennial series that focuses on topics of interest to elementary particle physicists, nuclear physicists and particle/nuclear astrophysicists. In addition to disseminating the latest results, CIPANP facilitates both formal and informal exchanges of information and the building of connections between physicists in these fields. The 12th CIPANP will be held May 19 through 24 in Vail, Colorado and will bring together physicists from around the word. This award supports the participation of young physicists and will be used to encourage a diverse group of participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CIPANP 2015 is organized with public lectures, plenary, parallel and poster sessions. Topic areas include Physics at High Energies; High Intensity and Precision Physics; Cosmic Physics and Dark Energy/Inflation; Neutrino Masses and Neutrino Mixing; Electroweak Tests of the Standard Model; Dark Matter; Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics; Heavy Flavor and CKM Matrix; QCD, Hadron Spectroscopy and Exotics; Partonic Distributions in Nucleon and Nuclei; Hadronic Physics and Structure of Nucleus and Nuclei; and Quark Matter and High Energy Heavy Ion Collisions. Proceedings will be published and presentations will be posted on the conference website.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>This award will support the Mathematics Research Communities (MRC) activities run by the American Mathematical Society (AMS) over a three-year period from 2017 - 2019.  The goal of the MRC program is to create research cohorts of early-career mathematicians that will sustain themselves over time and to foster joint research and coherent research programs that will, eventually, reach all areas of mathematics. The MRC program strives to achieve this goal through summer research conferences, Special Sessions at the annual AMS-MAA Joint Mathematics Meetings, support for collaboration travel, mentoring, and a discussion network. It is the formation of research cohorts that sets this program apart from any other (national) professional development programs for mathematicians that currently exist. The creation of three to four new cohorts per year has the potential to lay a foundation for decades of research, and will have an extremely positive effect on mathematics research in the U.S. Most importantly, this program will focus on mathematicians who are beginning their research careers; all program components will help to train and connect the next generation of researchers in, eventually, all research areas of mathematics. This grant provides support for an additional three years of this unique program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2017, there will be three MRC conferences supported, all to be held in Snowbird, Utah, with the following titles:  (1) Homotopy Type Theory, (2) Beyond Planarity:  Crossing Numbers of Graphs, and (3) Dynamical Systems:  Smooth, Symbolic, and Measurable.  The topics of the conferences to be held in 2018 and 2019 will be determined later by the MRC Advisory Board, which evaluates proposals submitted by senior mathematicians who wish to be organizers. Each of the MRC conferences will bring together a diverse group of early-career mathematicians. The organizing committee for each conference is composed of leaders in the field of the conference and includes individuals with previous experience in organizing successful workshops and conferences. The conferences will bring together senior and junior researchers in an ideal environment to establish connections, and the follow-up elements of the program will help to ensure those relationships endure for many years.

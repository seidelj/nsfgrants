    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL AND TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds in the amount of $5,000 are recommended in support of the travel of junior faculty and graduate students participating in the plenary symposium on ?Emerging Areas in Polymer Science and Engineering?, and the ?Excellence in Graduate Polymer Research? session, to be held at the American Institute of Chemical Engineering (AIChE) Annual meeting on Nov. 8-13, 2015 in Salt Lake City, UT. The planned ?Emerging Areas in Polymer Science and Engineering? plenary symposium, is comprehensive in scope aiming at the pulse of contemporary polymer science and engineering/applications, to the benefit of the chemical engineering community. The following topics will be emphasized in the planned plenary symposium: Organic photovoltaics and other energy-relevant polymeric materials; New routes for long-range ordering and alignment of block copolymers; Thermodynamics and polymerization kinetics in nanoconfined polymer films; Bioinspired and biocompatible polymers and surfaces; Bridging the gap between structure-property relationships in polyolefins and their industrial applications. The graduate student award symposium organized in conjunction with the plenary symposium will showcase recent results of highly qualified graduate students which have been nominated by their thesis advisors. Diversity among the chosen supported participants of both sessions is an aim of the proposal.</AbstractNarration>

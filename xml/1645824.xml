    <AbstractNarration>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) offer the promise for radical changes to our everyday life by enabling the physical world to be programmed in the same way that a computer is programmed. The physical world, however, is far less predictable than a computer and this renders the design of CPS very challenging. In order to reduce the impact of unforeseen events arising from the physical world, or even from the cyber world, this project develops a science of CPS robustness. A robust CPS will only modestly deviate from its desired behavior upon the occurrence of unforeseen circumstances and has the ability to recover once these disrupting circumstances subside. The intellectual merit of this project is the development of a science of CPS robustness that harnesses the intricate interactions between cyber and physical components to obtain CPS that are able to operate in a wide range of unpredictable environments. The project?s broader significance and importance is the enablement of vast number of applications requiring CPS to operate seamlessly in unpredictable environments such as the internet-of-things or smart and connected communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the technical level, this project leverages existing notions of robustness for cyber systems, such as self-stabilizing algorithms, and for physical systems, such as input-to-state stability, to create a science of CPS robustness. Expected outcomes include new temporal logics to specify CPS robustness, verification and synthesis algorithms for CPS robustness, as well as compositional design flows.</AbstractNarration>

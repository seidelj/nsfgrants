    <AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the 42nd and 43rd Spring Lecture Series, taking place at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, in March 2017 and April 2018 respectively. The award supports travel and lodging, both for the principal speakers and for graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and early career participants. These three-day conferences provide opportunities for dissemination of research results, discussions that lead to new connections and collaborations, and for professional development for junior participants. The conferences also include a public mathematics lecture aimed at broadening mathematical appreciation in the community, and networking events for women in mathematics and for graduate students. Further information can be found at the conference website: https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/math/research/spring-lecture-series/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2017 conference will feature lectures by Professor Robert Lazarsfeld of Stony Brook University on geometry and the equations defining projective varieties. This topic is of significant interest in both commutative algebra and algebraic geometry and is related to many of the most important open conjectures in both fields. The 2018 conference will feature lectures by Professor Kiran Kedlaya of the University of California at San Diego on new and old themes in p-adic cohomology. This topic has been of fundamental importance in arithmetic geometry and mixed characteristic commutative algebra and the talks will describe recent advances and relate them to the classical picture. In addition to the principal lecturer, both workshops will feature talks by ten of the world's leading experts in the respective fields, as well as contributed talks by participants and a small workshop for graduate students held in advance of the principal lecture.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>REU Site in Physics and Astronomy: Supporting Undergraduate Research at Geneseo (SURGE)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SURGE provides an exciting ten-week research experience to a cohort of six to eight undergraduates each year at the State University of New York at Geneseo, a nationally recognized center of excellence in physics education. REU students are integrated into small teams of undergraduate researchers working closely with a faculty mentor, who nurtures their experimental, analytical, and communication skills. Students also experience physics in action by visiting regional facilities, where they interact with practicing physicists. Active recruitment at community colleges expands research opportunities for underrepresented students and for those with limited research prospects. Retention of students in physics, especially women and other underrepresented groups, is supported by showing them how physics research addresses societally relevant problems, and also through an online mentoring community that persists after completion of the summer experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students in SURGE deepen their understanding of physics and astronomy through direct application of physics concepts to solve intriguing problems using state-of-the-art instrumentation. They design detection systems for inertial confinement fusion experiments, develop novel materials science techniques, analyze observational data on massive stars and on nearby open clusters, employ scanning probe microscopy, engineer automated positioning systems, and measure the optical properties of atmospheric aerosols. SURGE also expands knowledge about the impact of undergraduate research experiences, based on nationally normed assessments, independent evaluations, and post-experience assessment surveys.</AbstractNarration>

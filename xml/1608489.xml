    <AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The 2016 GRC in Biointerface Science will explore Active, Adaptive, and Responsive Biointerfaces across natural and engineered biomaterial systems. We reason that broad classes of complex, cooperative, and adaptive behaviors in natural and biomimetic systems emerge through the central roles of interfaces - both intrinsic and imposed. Biointerfaces on the one hand compartmentalize disparate biological components within a functional living module (e.g., a cell) and on the other hand facilitate integration. The appreciation of how interfaces determine biological functions and how interfaces must be considered in devising biomaterial alternatives to their living counterparts requires an interdisciplinary discourse, ranging over biomacromolecules and single cells to tissues and organs. The 2016 GRC seeks to seed this discourse, help generate a common language across disciplines, and foster interdisciplinary collaborations. The constituency of the Biointerface Science GRC attendees is already multidisciplinary. The 2016 GRC and the associated GRS will engage bioengineers, chemists, physicists, materials scientists, and biologists - all participating in a meeting that addresses the challenges in translating ground breaking fundamental advances in biology and chemistry into products in biomaterials, biosensors, and the -omic sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The Biointerface Science GRC and GRS play important roles in enhancing the development of researchers in early stages of their careers. The GRC format is designed to foster an environment of in-depth scientific discussion and relationship building among participants. The associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will draw in young scientists and researchers, and get them involved with one of the most lively frontiers of science. Graduate students, post-docs, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education will come together in a highly-stimulating and non-intimidating environment to discuss their current research and build informal networks with their peers that may lead to a lifetime of collaboration and scientific achievement. The GRS is organized by young investigators with the support of leading scientists from the associated GRC. The majority of the GRS participants will participate in the GRC, which follows immediately at the same site. The PI has made a concerted effort to achieve an appropriate representation of women, racial/ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities, and other individuals who in the past have been underrepresented in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

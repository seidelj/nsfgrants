    <AbstractNarration>Ebola virus spreads through human-to-human transmission via direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected people, and with surfaces and materials contaminated with these fluids. Hstar Technologies is developing and validating the Advanced Mobile Lifting and Transferring Robotic Nursing Assistant for Contagious Patients as a viable means for transporting patient without direct contact by care givers. A unique linkage system allows powerful, safe, and flexible lifting and positioning of the patient with a minimal number of actuators. The lifting mechanism is mounted on a low profile, stable and flexible footprint robotic mobile base for various terrains and among buildings. A simple, intuitive user interface allows control by a single caregiver with minimal training beside the robot or remotely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research includes developing feasible and novel cooperative nurse-robot protocols that will result in healthcare enhancement for both patients and caregivers. This project utilizes rapidly deployable, articulated robotic arms with gentle conveyor belts in reaction of urgent outbreak of contagious disease. Hstar Technologies is drawing upon its expertise in autonomous mobile platform, human robot interaction, operation control, robotic dexterous manipulation, and haptics.</AbstractNarration>

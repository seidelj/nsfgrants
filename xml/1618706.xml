<AbstractNarration>Graph algorithms are crucial to a wide range of big data applications from social network analysis, biological network analysis and simulation, to cybersecurity. Analyzing such graphs has important practical usages, e.g., providing targeted recommendations for e-commerce, as well as identifying person of interest and suspicious behaviors in social networks. Graph-based approaches rely heavily on a number of traversal methods, e.g., breadth-first search serves as one of the most significant building blocks for many graph algorithms. This project advances the state-of-the-art in graph traversal by achieving exceptional performance on both a single graphics processing unit (GPU) and large GPU-based supercomputers. New techniques developed in this project enable many graph applications to run efficiently in data centers, bringing enormous benefits to a number of scientific domains. New educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students are also enabled by this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although GPUs provide both massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth ideal for running graph algorithms, unleashing their full power to achieve high-performance, highly scalable graph traversal remains extremely challenging. The main obstacles are highly unbalanced workload and irregular data access, both inherent to data-driven graph algorithms. To address this challenge, this project develops a set of novel techniques that not only remove several performance bottlenecks, but also optimize data access, communication, and task management for graph traversal on GPUs.</AbstractNarration>

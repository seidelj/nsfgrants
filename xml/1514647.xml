    <AbstractNarration>Universities have funding mechanisms to pay administrators, staff, faculty members and graduate students. However, funding mechanisms to pay undergraduates for student-assisted learning are largely absent, and under budget constraints new funding is very difficult to obtain. A strategy other than continuing to repeat the grant proposal cycle is needed, in order to avoid gaps in funding and, therefore, gaps in the program's continuation. The goal of this I-CORPS L project is to develop a viable non-profit business strategy that can be implemented by educational institutions for the purpose of creating self-sustaining effective learning programs in STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed product is a system for funding and promoting learning excellence in the realm of peer-assisted learning programs. The system produces and sells customized books and other learning materials. The innovation and intellectual property (IP) contained in the materials is donated to non-profit organizations, where they are optimized for distribution to customers. Donors of the IP include a variety of individuals interested in supporting quality education. Lead for America Corporation (LFAC), has demonstrated proof of principle for the model proposed in this I-CORPS L proposal submission, producing and publishing customized workbooks for sale in university bookstores. The sale of these learning materials generates funds, which are used to support the learning programs and enhance STEM education on the campuses and classrooms where they are used. Campuses which adopt this strategy have considerable control over the customization of their materials as well as control over the input of the intellectual property that is used. By this innovation, funding issues that often impede the adoption of effective learning strategies can be resolved. Self-generated support through this proposed system offers long-term stability to peer-led and peer-assisted effective teaching and learning strategies.</AbstractNarration>

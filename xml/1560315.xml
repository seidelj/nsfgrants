    <AbstractNarration>This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a new REU site focuses on cybersecurity at Wright State University. Each summer, students will work with experienced faculty mentors state-of-the-art facilities and emerging tools and techniques to solve problems that are timely and important. The challenges of cybersecurity research provide an exciting opportunity for students to investigate fundamental principles and strategies to develop real-world, secure systems that we can all trust. This project is co-funded by the Cyber Corps (R): Scholarship for Service Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is led by an outstanding team offering modern facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of problems related to cybersecurity. The team will use proven strategies to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science. The team will also seek to include veterans who are returning to pursue computing degrees The students will participate in research and professional development activities all designed to achieve the goals of retaining and graduating undergraduate students in computer fields, recruiting students from groups traditionally under-represented in computing fields, developing students' confidence and capabilities of conducting independent research, and motivating students to pursue graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>General Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Variation in skin colors are linked to significant differences in life experiences, both within and across racial groups. For example, darker-skinned African Americans have worse health outcomes, lower incomes, lower levels of education, lower rates of marriage, and even receive harsher criminal sentencing than lighter-skinned African Americans. This project explores how skin color might influence political phenomena such public policy outcomes and candidate support. The work investigates this from the perspectives of both white and black people. This research has implications beyond just African Americans. Studying skin tone identity among Latinos and Asian Americans, for instance, would provide interesting comparison points. Furthermore, this research provides a foundation for understanding the significance of skin tone biases on a global bases, not just the United States. Investigating potential color-based discrimination will help inform strategies for addressing and mitigating such bias, to the benefit of political elites (such as political candidates from minority groups) as well as for the mass public who might face skin-color based discrimination in their everyday lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The study of racial groups in political science tends to treat these as homogenous. An implication of this approach is that such studies tend to overlook potentially important heterogeneity within racial groups, especially with respect to skin color. The research utilizes a mixed-methods design, relying on multiple observational datasets, original qualitative interview data, and a series of experiments to explore the underlying significance of skin color in the political realm. The findings from these multiple datasets and my in-depth interviews indicate that skin color is a socially and politically significant source of identity for many African Americans. This is especially true for darker-skinned African Americans. Further, skin color play a significant role in shaping political preferences in multiple domains. In contrast to existing theories of white racial attitudes towards blacks, I expect racially insensitive attitudes will not be equally directed at all African Americans, but will vary by skin tone. Overall, my research demonstrates that in addition to race, skin color operates as an important, yet poorly understood, factor in American politics.</AbstractNarration>

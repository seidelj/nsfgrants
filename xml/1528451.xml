    <AbstractNarration>Computer models of wind flow around and across terrain are important for topics such as weather forecasting, wind energy, and air pollution. Unfortunately, these models still struggle in complex terrain. To address these problems, a group of US scientists is planning on joining an existing European wind energy study in order to collect a reference data set with a set of instruments that will provide unprecedented views of the flow over two parallel hills in Portugal. This data set will likely be used in modeling studies for decades to come. This award provides funding for the planning activities to enhance the US contribution to the campaign. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Perdigao Field Experiment will take place in 2017 in Portugal, mainly funded by a consortium of European countries interested in wind energy resource planning. The US component of the project would bring additional instrumentation and a more basic science focus on microscale meteorology in complex terrain. The award that is being funded is considered a Scientific Planning Overview document and serves as the scientific basis for the campaign. Individual science proposals will be reviewed separately.</AbstractNarration>

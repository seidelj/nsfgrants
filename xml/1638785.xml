    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to subsidize student-related travel expenses incurred by US university students attending the 2016 edition of the annual North American Power Symposium (NAPS). NAPS 2016 will be hosted by the University of Denver in Denver, CO, from September 18 to September 20, 2016. NAPS is a nonprofit event with technical sponsorship from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and is aimed primarily at a student audience. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of papers in NAPS are presented by students. NAPS has been supported by the National Science Foundation in the past, which has positively influenced student participation. Based on the attendance trend from previous years, it is anticipated that the subsidy provided through this grant can significantly increase the number of students participating in NAPS in this year as well. In addition to providing subsidized accommodation for students, the organizers' efforts to foster and encourage student participation include a comprehensive student program, tours of nearby attractions, and a student paper competition with awards. Moreover, measures will be taken to encourage participation of women and underrepresented minorities in NAPS.</AbstractNarration>

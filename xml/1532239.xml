    <AbstractNarration>The development of a new instrument for simultaneous assessment of brain, muscular, and nervous system output during functional arm and hand tasks will provide unprecedented insight into the inner workings of arm and hand function, including movement intention and movement performance. The developed BiLateral Upper-extremity Exoskeleton for Simultaneous Assessment of Biomechanical and Neuromuscular Output (BLUE SABINO) would be the first of its kind with the ability to record extensive metrics from both left and right hemispheres of the brain, muscle activation patterns, and movement of both left and right arms simultaneously. Particularly evident in populations with neuromuscular impairment, there is a gap in our current knowledge between the action potentials generated by the brain and the resulting movements generated by the muscles. This Major Research Instrumentation award will address this gap by facilitating a better understanding of arm function along the full neuromuscular pathway from thought to action. BLUE SABINO will also enable further study on a variety of cutting-edge research areas from brain-computer-interfaces and virtual environment simulation to advanced control of industrial and medical robotics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BLUE SABINO will combine the mechanical precision and repeatability of a 28 degree-of-freedom (DOF) dual-arm exoskeleton, with existing high-end acquisition systems for collecting electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) data from the brain and neuromuscular system, as well as processing algorithms to compute general assessment metrics. The exoskeleton components will allow natural reach and grasp movements through two 14-DOF (12 active, 2 passive) wearable arms. EEG and EMG acquisition will be performed with at least 32 and 64 channels, respectively, per side. Together, the instrument will provide a groundbreaking, holistic instrument for quantitative assessment and evaluation of arm function not currently possible. Acquisition of biometric data from both left and right sides of the body will allow evaluation of unilateral and bimanual activities of daily living (ADL), as well as a means of monitoring and evaluating task performance for both healthy and impaired users. The comprehensive assessment capacity will enable transformative research across a wide spectrum of domains including: functional outcome assessment, computation and planning of targeted therapeutic approaches, advanced therapy/response correlations, novel brain-machine-body rehabilitation paradigms, and development and optimization of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and brain-controlled neuroprosthetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported by the Engineering Directorate's Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI) Division along with the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) Division.</AbstractNarration>

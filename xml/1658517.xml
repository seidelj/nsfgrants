    <AbstractNarration>Drastic changes in the global water cycle and increases in ice melt are causing the freshening of Northern coastal seas. The combination of both reduced salinity and increased temperature will likely act in concert to reduce populations of estuarine and marine organisms. Data indicate that reduced salinity and high temperature would each increase the energy costs as well as reduce survival and reproduction of the common copepod Eurytemora affinis. This project will examine the joint effects of salinity reduction and temperature increase on the evolutionary responses of populations of E. affinis in the wild, as well as in selection experiments in the laboratory. This study will provide novel insights into responses of organisms to climate change, as no study has analyzed the joint impacts of salinity and temperature on evolutionary responses, and relatively few studies have examined the impacts of declining salinity. In general, how selection acts at the whole genome level is not well understood, particularly for non-model organisms. As a dominant estuarine copepod, E. affinis is among the most important species sustaining coastal food webs and fisheries in the Northern Hemisphere, such as salmon, herring, and anchovy. Thus, insights into its evolutionary responses with changing climate have important implications for sustainability of fisheries and food security. Two graduate students from historically underrepresented groups will be trained during this project. The project will have additional societal benefits, including development of educational modules for K-12 students and international collaboration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will address the following questions: (1) To what extent could populations evolve in response to salinity and temperature change, and what are the fitness and physiological costs? (2) How will populations respond to the impacts of salinity-temperature interactions? (3) Do wild populations show evidence of natural selection in response to salinity and temperature? To analyze the evolutionary responses of E. affinis populations to the coupled impacts of salinity and temperature, the investigator will perform laboratory selection experiments and population genomic surveys of wild populations. Selection experiments constitute powerful tools for determining the rate, trajectory, and limits of adaptation. During laboratory selection, evolutionary shifts in fitness-related traits and genomic expression will be examined, as well as genomic signatures of selection in response to low salinity and high temperature selection regimes. The investigator will also conduct population genomic sequencing of E. affinis populations that reside along salinity and temperature gradients in the St. Lawrence and Baltic Sea, and identify genes that show signatures of selection. The project will determine whether the loci that show signatures of selection in the wild populations are the same as those favored during laboratory selection. This reproducibility will provide greater confidence that the genes involved in adaptation to salinity and/or temperature have been captured.</AbstractNarration>

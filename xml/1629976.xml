    <AbstractNarration>Improving software quality is a central priority of our time.&lt;br/&gt;Approaches to understand, diagnose, localize, and fix software defects&lt;br/&gt;are usually empirically grounded in datasets of past defects/repairs.&lt;br/&gt;A few such datasets are available; however, these datasets are&lt;br/&gt;difficult to create, and are typically not of the size, scale, and&lt;br/&gt;diversity that is representative of the software in use. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to create BugSwarm, a large-scale repository of&lt;br/&gt;replicable defects, tests, and patches. We propose to draw from the&lt;br/&gt;recorded history of defects in open-source projects, to create this&lt;br/&gt;dataset of unprecedented size and diversity, while retaining&lt;br/&gt;sufficient fidelity of detail to allow careful study and replication&lt;br/&gt;of these historical defects. BugSwarm will amplify the size of&lt;br/&gt;available defect datasets by several orders of magnitude.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Continuous integration (CI) development practices, where build and&lt;br/&gt;test processes are carried out in the cloud, with archived results,&lt;br/&gt;offer a novel opportunity to construct defect datasets. We propose to&lt;br/&gt;exploit CI coding practices to create BugSwarm. Continuous, online&lt;br/&gt;integration practices inherently create archived records of build and&lt;br/&gt;test attempts, including those that result in build and/or test&lt;br/&gt;failures, and subsequent repairs. These practices emerged from the&lt;br/&gt;imperatives to: a) rigorously and automatically build, integrate, and&lt;br/&gt;fully test numerous code submissions from volunteer developers; and b)&lt;br/&gt;the need to test these submissions at large volumes, in virtualized,&lt;br/&gt;configurable, cloud-based settings. The virtualized, cloud-based&lt;br/&gt;testing makes these defects much more available and replicable. We&lt;br/&gt;will exploit these archived records to create DRPs (Defect Replication&lt;br/&gt;Packages) and DFRPs (Defect &amp; Fix Replication Packages), comprising&lt;br/&gt;buggy versions of the code, failing regression tests, and bug fixes.&lt;br/&gt;DRPs and DFRPs will include complete virtual machines to reproduce&lt;br/&gt;real test failures. BugSwarm will facilitate experimentation, and&lt;br/&gt;avoid the duplication of a tremendous amount of work among researchers&lt;br/&gt;in programming languages, and software engineering.</AbstractNarration>

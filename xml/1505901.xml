    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Doped semiconductor nanostructures are ubiquitous in energy conversion, energy storage, photocatalysis, information processing, and information storage technologies, and they are central to numerous futuristic device technologies including spin-based electronics. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project is generating new forms of matter on nanometer length scales made from semiconductors doped with impurities. This project is also applying sophisticated physical measurement techniques to elucidate the technologically relevant physical properties of these doped nanocrystals. The knowledge gained from this project has broad implications for each of these technologies. In addition to yielding new fundamental scientific knowledge and new forms of matter, this project is also providing advanced technical training for participating undergraduate and graduate students to prepare them for future careers in science, engineering, and education. Special emphasis is being placed on integrating research and education at the undergraduate level through aggressive involvement of undergraduates in this research, incorporation of experiments and concepts from this research into the University of Washington undergraduate curriculum, hosting faculty and students from undergraduate institutions as visiting scientists at University of Washington, and mature outreach activities at Seattle-area community colleges and high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This research is developing new colloidal luminescent nanomaterials based on lanthanide- and transition-metal doped semiconductor quantum dots that show unprecedented photophysical and magneto-optical properties relevant to advanced information-processing, imaging, spectral conversion, and energy conversion technologies. A balanced research effort integrating synthetic, spectroscopic, photophysical, and magneto-optical methodologies is being applied to develop a fundamental understanding of the structure/function relationships that govern the physical properties of these materials. This project targets a thorough understanding of delayed luminescence and excitonic magnetic polaron phenomena in doped quantum dots, development of new methodologies for exploiting delayed luminescence to probe quantum dot surface electron traps, elucidation of the magneto-optical properties of lanthanide-doped quantum dots, and translation of research discoveries into patentable technologies and educational tools. This research will yield new fundamental scientific insights that will define the ways such materials are made and understood, and will accelerate the emergence of applied technologies based on such materials, including in information processing, spectral conversion, imaging, and energy conversion technologies.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The Division of Chemistry is sponsoring this workshop entitled "Quantum Information and Quantum Computation for Chemistry: Challenges and Opportunities" to be held on November 14-15, 2016 in Arlington, Virginia. Since the early contributions by Richard Feynman in 1982, quantum information science and technology has become one of the most dynamic and promising fields of scientific endeavor. The possibility of accessing new forms of cryptography, communication, and computation has led to new intellectual frameworks for understanding our physical reality as well as to the understanding of the complexity of different tasks such as the simulation of quantum systems. The field of chemistry, with its core at the quantum realm has several points of contact with quantum information science and computation. The physical implementation of quantum information processors is poised to benefit from chemistry-related advances starting from surface science, nanoscale control and spectroscopy. The understanding of chemistry, on the other hand, benefits from the promise of scalable, efficient quantum simulation of chemical systems enabled by quantum simulators and full-blown quantum computers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professors Michael Wasielewski (Northwestern University) and Alan Aspuru-Guzik (Harvard University) are organizing a workshop that brings together a representative sample of the leading researchers working on the topic of quantum information and quantum computing. Through a series of discussions, the workshop participants develop deep perspectives on the challenges and opportunities for Chemistry in the field of quantum information science and technology in a timescale of five to ten years. The participating researchers are a mixture of theoreticians and experimentalists with a variety of backgrounds. The long term goal of this workshop is to develop a new subfield of chemistry at the interface of the core of the discipline with the emerging fields of quantum information and quantum computation. The outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated to the scientific community via a workshop report.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>With the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands, millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz have been attracting growing attention as a possible candidate for next-generation micro- and pico-cellular wireless networks. The mmWave bands offer orders of magnitude greater spectrum than current cellular allocations and enable very high-dimensional antenna arrays for further gains via beam-forming and spatial multiplexing. However, due to unique nature of propagation in these frequencies, cellular systems will need to be significantly redesigned to fully exploit the potential of these frequencies. This project investigates one key dimension in mmWave network design: resource sharing, involving the sharing of spectrum and network infrastructure resources by multiple operators. It is argued that sharing of this form will be essential to fully exploit the tremendous bandwidth and antenna degrees of freedom offered by these bands and also provide statistical multiplexing to accommodate the highly variable nature of traffic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This inter-disciplinary project explores both the engineering and economic aspects of mmWave resource sharing. On the engineering side, the key challenge is that the spectrum must be shared not only in time and frequency, but also space. In addition, new decentralized mechanisms are required to rapidly reallocate backhaul and core network elements across multiple parties. The project develops signal processing methods, protocols and network optimization algorithms to facilitate directional sharing of spectrum along with dynamic re-routing and load balancing. On the economic and policy side, several shared ownership models under varying forms of licensing agreements between the operators, regulatory agencies and third-party spectrum and resource brokers are investigated. Based on the capacity estimates obtained from the engineering side, economic models are developed to assess key indicators such as operating and capital costs and coalition formation and market concentration.</AbstractNarration>

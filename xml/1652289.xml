<AbstractNarration>The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is one of the main sources for the subseasonal predictability. The MJO is a special type of organized tropical convection systems which is distinct from others types by its vast horizontal spatial scale, subseasonal time scale, and eastward propagation over the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Enhanced or suppressed convection associated with the MJO affects global weather and climate, thereby providing a source of predictability in the subseasonal time scale. Therefore, understanding the essential dynamics and predictability of the MJO is key to improving subseasonal prediction in the tropics as well as MJO-related phenomena in the mid-latitude. The objectives of this study are to understand the predictability of the MJO and its impacts on predictability of high-impact weather events (such as extreme precipitation along the west coast). The main tasks are (i) to investigate the theoretical limit of the MJO, (ii) to investigate the physical processes for MJO propagation and the impact of the mean state change, and (iii) to examine the underlying mechanisms of the associations of MJO with extreme precipitation events. The research project will utilize satellite observations, reanalysis, and numerical experiments with a climate model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Improving our understanding of subseasonal predictability will have global impacts on agriculture, commerce, healthcare, and food production. Better prediction of the MJO and related high-impact extreme precipitation events will provide policy makers, emergency managers, and other stakeholders with advanced warnings to prepare for mitigation measures. The goal of the educational activities is to increase diversity in atmospheric science by increasing the number of under-represented minority and women students. More specifically, the objectives are (i) to build strong collaborations with local community colleges in order to foster collaborative growth with their atmospheric science programs, (ii) to increase the number of under-represented minority students that transfer from community colleges to 4-year atmospheric science programs, and (iii) to culminate with their studies either into the atmospheric science workforce or graduate school. The educational activities will focus on enhancing computer programming skills and on improving research ability for under-represented minority and women students, thereby increasing diversity in the atmospheric science field.</AbstractNarration>

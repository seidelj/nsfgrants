    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the research of Professors Katrin Becker and Melanie Becker at Texas A&amp;M University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the biggest challenges in fundamental physics is to develop a unified description of physical phenomena at very large and very small distances. For large distances we use general relativity, and for small distances we use quantum theory. One of the most successful candidates for unifying these two descriptions is string theory, and in particular its most recent generalization into what is called M-theory. After almost twenty years since the discovery of M-theory, we have learned a great deal about this enigmatic theory. However, there are still countless questions about M-theory that are waiting to be answered. As part of their research, Professors K. Becker and M. Becker will explore the formulation, theory, and phenomenology of M-theory. This work advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science at the most fundamental level: the discovery and understanding of the elementary building blocks of matter and of the universe at astronomical scales. The project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professors K. Becker and M. Becker will involve graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in their research, and thus provide critical training to junior physicists working in this field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, in their research Professors K. Becker and M. Becker will explore the existence of quantum theories that capture the symmetries of M-theory, its higher-order corrections, and their impact on spacetime geometry.</AbstractNarration>

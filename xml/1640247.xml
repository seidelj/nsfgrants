    <AbstractNarration>The University of California Irvine (UCI) project, called CS1C@OC, will provide in-service teachers&lt;br/&gt;in Orange County (OC), California a program of study that will satisfy California's new teacher&lt;br/&gt;certification pathway in Computer Science. Despite the demonstrated need for students to learn&lt;br/&gt;foundational computer science skills, few K-12 students have access to rigorous CS courses. CS&lt;br/&gt;remains privileged knowledge, and improving access to this knowledge is one of the major&lt;br/&gt;economic security and social justice issues of the 21st century. The CS community has struggled to&lt;br/&gt;overcome issues of access and equity, although some enormous strides have come in teaching tools,&lt;br/&gt;pedagogies, and standards. But none of these accomplishments can be broadly implemented or&lt;br/&gt;sustainable without certification pathways for CS teachers and teacher preparation programs,&lt;br/&gt;especially for those teaching in underserved communities. CS1C@OC will develop such a CS&lt;br/&gt;teacher preparation program, specifically for California's new CS Supplementary Authorization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CS1C@0C aims to (1) increase in-service teachers' CS content knowledge and their competence and&lt;br/&gt;confidence in evidence-based pedagogical practices for teaching computer science to diverse&lt;br/&gt;learners; (2) increase diverse students' knowledge and skills in computational thinking and&lt;br/&gt;computer science principles as well as their interest in taking more CS courses; and (3) increase the&lt;br/&gt;capacity of Orange County schools to provide CS courses. CS1C@OC will recruit and train 100&lt;br/&gt;secondary school teachers--our share of the CS10K project (OC has approximately 10% of the&lt;br/&gt;nation's population)--largely from low-income communities serving underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;populations, with preference given to teachers who, along with their school, make a commitment to&lt;br/&gt;teach Exploring Computer Science (ECS) and/or Computer Science Principles (CSP). UCI will&lt;br/&gt;provide summer courses in CS content and pedagogy that will satisfy the requirements for&lt;br/&gt;California's newly-approved Computer Science Supplementary Authorization (which PI Richardson&lt;br/&gt;proposed and developed along with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing) while&lt;br/&gt;emphasizing CS instructional approaches that have proven successful with females and students&lt;br/&gt;from low-income, underrepresented communities. The project will also develop a hybrid&lt;br/&gt;professional learning community (PLC) for participating teachers and including existing OC CS&lt;br/&gt;teachers, so they can share information and experiences, continue to learn from each other, and&lt;br/&gt;have further opportunities to develop themselves both personally and professionally throughout&lt;br/&gt;the school year. The project will evaluate impact on teacher learning and development as well as&lt;br/&gt;impact on student learning and attitude changes.</AbstractNarration>

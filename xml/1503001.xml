    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the participation of U.S. graduate students in the Urbino Summer School in Paleoclimatology (USSP). Held at the University of Urbino, in Italy, the USSP leverages the expertise of internationally-recognized experts from Europe and the US to provide a two-and-a-half-week intensive, immersive learning experience in paleoclimate research topics and methods for an cohort of ~60 students from around the world. These students present their own research and participate in lecture- and lab-style classes while broadening their research networks in an international setting. Each session of the USSP brings in a new group of students and provides fresh opportunities for international collaboration. The experience of previous students suggests that participation in the USSP lays a foundation for success, including international collaborations both with their peers and with more senior researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly ten scholarships are awarded each year to outstanding applicants who are selected on a competitive basis.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating promising cloud computing and data processing research results to an application in the petroleum industry: a next generation petroleum data analytics platform. This integrated, easy-to-use platform will ease the daily work of big data processing and analytics in the petroleum industry. It will simplify the geophysicists' and data scientists' new algorithm design and facilitate their daily data interpretation and analytics work. The project will result in a prototype with the following unique features: high-level programming environment, rich data analytics packages, domain specific libraries, user-friendly web interface, flexible workflow and parallel seismic processing templates. These features provide the following advantages: scalable performance, high productivity, cost savings, and flexibility when compared to the leading competing generic data analytics platforms in this market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. 1) Design efficient data storage and distributions for petroleum data sets; 2) simplify parallelization efforts for new seismic data processing and analytics algorithm design; 3) apply the latest big data analytics discovery to support geological feature detection; 4) achieve both scalable performance and high productivity for petroleum data analytics. In addition, personnel involved in this project, including graduate and undergraduate students, will receive entrepreneurship experiences through I-Corps customer discovery work and this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project engages TEC Application Analysis and the Texas A&amp;M System Technology and Commercialization office to augment research capability with deep domain knowledge, guide commercialization aspects, and to perform marketing analysis in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.</AbstractNarration>

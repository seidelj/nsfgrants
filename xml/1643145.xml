    <AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;There has been growing interest in a new class of material system known as topological insulators, which are known to harbor topologically protected conducting surface states. The charges forming these topologically protected states are expected to have fascinating properties arising from the way they are forced to spin as they are moving. The project will explore these unique properties, also known as the helical spin structure, by performing direct spin detection experiments on samarium hexaboride, which has no charges in its bulk at cryogenic temperatures and test new device concepts that rely on unique properties of topological surface states. On the educational side, the project will provide excellent training for graduate and undergraduate students. The principal investigator will also be leveraging University of Michigan's existing REU and Master's bridge programs to bring in a student from an underrepresented group to join this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;There has been growing interest in a new class of material system known as topological insulators, which are known to harbor topologically protected conducting surface states. The transport properties of the surface of topological insulators are expected to be quite unique, arising from the helical spin structure of surface electrons. Even though such surface states have been seen in many materials, in most cases these materials are actually bulk conductors, and not true insulators making electrical characterization of these surface states very challenging. In this project, topological surface will be studied in samarium hexaboride, which has recently been discovered to be a correlated topological insulator with a truly insulating bulk. The helical spin structure will be detected using specially designed spin injection devices incorporating magnetic tunnel junction together with Corbino experiments performed on different surfaces of samarium hexaboride. The Corbino and spin injection devices will be fabricated using standard lithographic techniques on high quality samarium hexaboride crystals grown both using floating zone and Al flux methods. The transport experiments will be performed at cryogenic temperatures and high magnetic fields. If successful, these experiments will unambiguously reveal the topological nature of surface states. Probing the helical spin structure using purely transport measurements will be critically important in moving the field forward. These experiments will also provide new opportunities to study the interplay between strong-correlation effects and topology in the search for new principles of physics. The project will provide excellent training for the graduate and undergraduate students. The principal investigator will also be leveraging University of Michigan's existing REU and Masters bridge programs to bring in a student from an underrepresented group to join this project.</AbstractNarration>

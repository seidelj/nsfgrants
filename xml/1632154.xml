<AbstractNarration>Currently product design and manufacturing are accessible only to enterprises and professionals such as engineers and designers. Everyone has ideas but only a select few can bring them to fabrication. This is because of lack of intuitive and easy-to-use design tools, detailed knowledge required to make prototypes, help needed for users with difficulties, and access to fabrication facilities. This gap could be seen as a waste of untapped human creative resources and economic potential to the Nation. MAKERPAD will bridge the gaps between the need for design tools for personalized production and the rapid growth of 3D fabrication technologies by providing intuitive tools for designing and access to remote fabrication resources. Using the cloud, MAKERPAD will enable personalized fabrication technology easily accessible and available to makers and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MAKERPAD is enabled by (a) 3D mixed and augmented reality, (b) cloud-powered algorithms (shape modeling, computer vision, human computer interaction), and (c) service models supporting 3D scanning, searching and printing. Using the affordances created by depth sensing cameras that are being embedded into both mobile and intuitive fabrication oriented design modeling, smart algorithms will be enabled to work real-time over the cloud. MAKERPAD will develop and use the human-centric cognitively intuitive design interfaces, digital modeling in the virtual cloud world, thus enabling connectivity to a personalized fabrication network. Using a new robotic toy platform as well as accessories as the use case, the service model design will appropriately support consumers at various levels of capabilities. The workflow at the user and system level will be designed in a seamless fashion for the users to obtain laser cut and 3D printed models of their designs. If successful, this system will support different levels of service, quality and sophistication of digital designs and physical models depending on the user requirements, usage context, budget and time constraints. The smart system will dynamically configure the appropriate technologies, providers and approaches, such as Do-It-Yourself (DIY) as well as concierge services, to deliver the optimal level of solution to the user.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration between Purdue University (Mechanical, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Business School) and primary implementation partner gesture interface technology ZeroUI (San Jose, CA, small business). Secondary partners for test-beds include a museum (Imagination Station, Lafayette, IN, non-profit) and gifted education research institute (GERI, Purdue University). Other partners include augmented reality - Meta (Portola Valley, CA, medium business); and depth sensing camera - Leap (San Francisco, CA, medium business).</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The sizes of scientific datasets are growing exponentially across all scientific disciplines due to several factors such as improved scientific instrumentation, social media and decreasing costs of storage. To extract real value from these geographically distant datasets, researchers need to have access to these datasets at high speeds which is typically not possible with traditional campus networks. The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) is building "HPRNet", a high performance research network providing last mile connectivity for over 31 research projects. HPRNet not only improves the ongoing research productivity, but also sets the stage for future innovations and collaborations. UIC is a public university and minority serving institution (MSI) in the heart of Chicago area where HPRNet significantly impacts the research training of underrepresented groups. The project team is working with other NSF and institutionally funded minority training programs on campus to ensure access to HPRNet resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For HPRNet's deployment, 13 locations are identified at UIC where 10 to 40 Gigabit uplinks to regional, national and international R&amp;E networks are established. HPRNet builds on the Science DMZ model that works in concert with the current campus research network (CRN) and a special data storage system known as Data Transfer Node (DTN) to deliver high-performance and reliable network paths for data-intensive applications, including high-volume bulk data transfer, remote experiment and/or instrumentation control, cloud computing, data-mining and advanced visualization.</AbstractNarration>

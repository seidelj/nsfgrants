    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor William Dougherty from Susquehanna University and colleagues Geneive Henry and Elizabeth Valentin have upgraded a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer by equipping it with a new radio frequency console, a broadband probe capable of operating between -100 and +150 degrees Centigrade and a 24-position autosampler. The upgraded electronics for the spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as those that allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. The results from these NMR studies have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. The acquired probe acts both as a broadband and high-field probe which increases sensitivity. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate students via independent student research and traditional academic coursework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) understanding the influence chemical structure has on the redox properties of transition metal complexes; (b) studying the redox properties of first row transition metal complexes bearing sterically bulky trispyrazolylborate ligands and (c) isolating and spectroscopically characterizing natural products from Carex (grassy plants or sedge) and Hypericum species (herbaceous shrubs) growing in Pennsylvania.</AbstractNarration>

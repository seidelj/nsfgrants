    <AbstractNarration>This collaborative project will facilitate a three-year international research experience for U.S. undergraduates majoring in STEM disciplines. Students from a diverse regional population will be recruited as summer cohorts to participate in research projects with researchers from the Brazilian Science-Technology Corridor (Sao Paulo - Campinas - Sao Carlos). The interest in analytical applications combining microfluidics and nanomaterials has grown exponentially in the last years. Considering these advances and their importance for future developments, this IRES program aims to provide the tools for students to develop the skills required to face an internationally competitive job market linked to chemical analysis. This proposal aims to boost education and training in a creative, multidisciplinary, and culturally-rich environment. A focus on minority recruiting, combined with the involvement of graduate students as mentors, will provide the support mechanisms required to expand and strengthen the pool of participants as well as the research experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments in nanotechnology and microfluidics have allowed the understanding and rational utilization of a series of micro total analysis systems (uTAS). The existing links between these two fields have enabled crossing the traditional borders and the development of unique training opportunities for students in science and engineering tracks. Furthermore, the interest in analytical applications combining microfluidics and nanomaterials has grown exponentially in the last years. Although this integration has enhanced sensing, separation, and extraction procedures, the applicability of specific nanomaterials for chemical analysis depends mainly on the chemical composition, structure, size, morphology, and preparation method. Considering these characteristics and their importance for future developments, this IRES program aims to provide students an enriching research experience and link chemical properties with a real-world analytical problem.</AbstractNarration>

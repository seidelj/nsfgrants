    <AbstractNarration>This award serves the national interest by promoting the progress of science and technology via the professional development of US students in the areas of connected and autonomous vehicles. This award will support US students with respect to attending the first-ever IEEE VTS Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Summer School @ WPI, a 2-day training event designed to educate attendees regarding connected and autonomous vehicle theory and technology. Given the growing importance of connected and autonomous vehicles with respect to road safety and the national economy, this award will support the professional formation of the next generation of technological leader and innovators in this emerging area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the IEEE VTS Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Summer School @ WPI is to engage industry researchers, academic faculty members, and students in interdisciplinary discussions on connected vehicles and autonomy. Traditionally, these two areas of research are pursued by different research communities, and this summer school will provide a common platform for members of these two communities to exchange ideas and technical expertise. Throughout this summer school, experts from industry and academia will deliver 90-minute tutorial-style seminars to highlight current trends and challenges in connected technologies, vehicular perception, optimal control, and autonomy. Additionally, a student poster session will be held, which will provide opportunities for presentation and discussion of ongoing research topics in these areas. The anticipated outcome of this Summer School includes new collaborations between researchers in these two communities for addressing the challenges of future road transportation systems.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Non-axisymmetric components, components which are not symmetric about their center, are prevalent in many engineering applications. Examples of these components include engine camshafts and piston heads. Manufacturing of these components requires multiple extremely precise and expensive cutting and grinding processes. Combining these processes into one machine would greatly reduce the cost of producing these parts both in terms of time and money, and decrease errors caused by the need to switch machines for different phases of processing. Recently, Professor Yoshitaka Morimoto of the Kanazawa Institute of Technology in Japan has created a new machine capable of producing these non-axisymmetric components using traditional cutting tools called Non-Axisymmetric Curved Surface Turning (NACS-Turning). NACS-Turning is capable of producing the desired geometry, but leaves undesired cutting marks on the workpiece. In order to correct this condition, this project proposes the combination of Professor Morimoto?s machine with a Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) tool designed by the PI to remove the cutting marks and smooth the surface of the workpiece. This will create a single machine capable of cutting and smoothing components to the desired specifications. As a result, creation of these essential, but difficult to manufacture, components will be significantly faster and cheaper. Travel to Professor Morimoto?s laboratory in Japan is necessary because NACS- Turning does not exist anywhere else in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NACS-Turning is accomplished with the use of a machine which features a unique computer aided machining (CAM) program found only in Prof. Morimoto?s laboratory. MAF can be applied to components machined with NACS-Turning through the use of a newly developed hybrid-tool. The hybrid-tool utilized a binder to create a fixed abrasive tool capable of performing grinding operations. As the tool wears and mixes with the applied lubricant, the binder breaks down. This allows the MAF particles to move freely in a loose abrasive phase, and polish the surface of the workpiece to nanometer level surface roughness values. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: &lt;br/&gt;Rechargeable solid-state batteries are attractive for electric vehicles and mobile applications because of their high energy density and their potential for improved safety compared to lithium-ion batteries. Despite the recent development of new ceramic materials for fast conduction of lithium ions, these battery systems are not yet commercialized. A major outstanding problem is that the solid-state interfaces between the ion-conducting ceramics and other materials within the battery are unstable, which leads to poor battery lifetimes. To address this challenge, this research uses novel experimental techniques to understand interface degradation processes in real time and to determine how to protect these interfaces from degradation. This fundamental understanding is critical for the creation of reliable, long-lasting solid-state batteries. This work is being performed by both graduate and undergraduate students, who are being trained in the science of materials for energy applications. Furthermore, this research includes an educational initiative in which new high school curriculum is being developed in collaboration with a high school teacher. The curriculum is focused on integrating materials and energy sciences in ways that are relevant to high school students' daily lives. These new learning tools will better prepare high school students from underrepresented groups for careers in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS: &lt;br/&gt;Interfacial transformations and instabilities at ceramic electrolyte interfaces in alkali metal-based solid-state batteries often cause increased impedance and reduced cycle life. The goal of this research is to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of structure, chemistry, and morphology at ceramic electrolyte interfaces within solid-state batteries, and to determine how these factors influence the ionic conductivity and stability of ceramic electrolytes. Multiple in situ experimental techniques are being used to probe nanoscale transformations at ceramic electrolyte/alkali metal interfaces before and during battery operation, and the influence of tailored protection layers on interfacial transformations are also being examined. By directly revealing nanoscale transformations at ceramic electrolyte interfaces for the first time, this research is helping to create the scientific foundation for stabilizing critical interfaces in next-generation solid-state batteries, thereby enabling superior new energy storage technologies.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The conference "Representation theory and geometry of symplectic resolutions" will be held May 18-21 at Northeastern University, Boston MA. Symplectic resolutions are remarkable geometric objects that are of increasing interest in representation theory, a branch of algebra concerned with studying symmetries. The conference speakers are experts who have made fundamental contributions to the theory of symplectic resolutions. The conference will attract mathematicians from underrepresented groups as well as graduate students and young researchers who will greatly benefit from the wide spectrum of topics to be presented at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the conference is to present current developments on various aspects of algebraic and symplectic geometry of symplectic resolutions, and of related aspects in representation theory. Topics to be discussed include the enumerative geometry of symplectic resolutions, the structure of derived categories of sympectic resolutions and their equivalences, and the structure and representation theory of quantizations of symplectic resolutions, as well as related questions in geometric and categorical representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For more information see the conference web-site: http://math.mit.edu/conferences/symplectic-resolutions/index.php</AbstractNarration>

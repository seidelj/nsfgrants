    <AbstractNarration>Driven by discoveries, and enabled by leaps in technology and imagination, our understanding of the Universe has changed dramatically over the course of the last few decades. The fields of astronomy and astrophysics continue to create new connections to physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. Realizing these scientific opportunities is contingent upon maintaining and strengthening the foundations of the research enterprise. Based on the decadal survey of astronomy and astrophysics, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics, the Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA) identifies issues of concern to the astronomy and astrophysics community and provides guidance to federal agencies regarding their astronomy and astrophysics research programs in order to encourage the field?s scientific progress. The CAA is under the auspices of the Board on Physics and Astronomy and the Space Studies Board of the Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences at the National Academy of Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities of the Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics serve to disseminate information from the supporting agencies into the broader community, as well as provide the agency officials with community-based input. The CAA routinely gathers input from the astronomy, astrophysics, and physics communities. Additionally, members of the committee converse with agency officials, congressional staff, and members of the astronomy and astrophysics community. Staff and committee members also participate in annual meetings of the American Astronomical Society and, occasionally, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and American Physical Society. The CAA is supported by NASA and NSF.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project centers around using scientifically based educational research and innovative data management and analysis techniques to support improvements in Pre-K through 12th grade education through more efficient and rigorous teacher evaluation processes. The American educational system needs substantial improvement if it is to inspire both the innovation and creativity needed now and in the future. The preparation of American students to meet the challenges of the 21st century is of both national interest and concern. As societal functioning becomes progressively more knowledge intensive, it increasingly relies more upon human capacity to learn and innovate. Consistent with the mission of the National Science Foundation to transform scientific discovery into societal and economic benefit, this project can have untold societal benefits as improved teaching practice leads to more learning. The system has great potential for generation of taxable revenue through the sale of the software and associated training services. The company will hire additional researchers, experts in evaluation, professional developers, technical support staff and clerical staff as it quickly grows at the conclusion of Phase I and prepares for Phase II. Acknowledging that research suggests that the most important factor effecting student learning is the classroom teacher, this project leverages scientific research about classroom practice in the teacher evaluation process to build teaching capacity. It recognizes a critical disconnect between contemporary labor intensive and low yield bureaucratic teacher evaluation processes and the efficient dissemination of actionable best practice feedback. Theoretically, consistent with constructivism, you cannot think, assess or make valid and reliable decisions without using a mental model to simplify the process. Traditionally, each state education department, school district, school and even classrooms have operated as their own informational silos. The way that society organizes institutions, develops professional networks that utilize common professional language, and classifies expectations for professional conduct has critical impact on how society, business and the economy function. Teacher evaluation needs a shared taxonomy to operate optimally while still affording contextual sensitivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an innovative technological model built upon extensive qualitative and quantitative research related to the language involved in evaluation, feedback that includes targeted, substantiated evaluatory comments, strategies and reflective questions that are already coded to evaluation rubrics, is made readily accessible. This schema is articulated in software that affords the user opportunities to quickly craft and revise evaluation documents. The software works to develop the capacity of the evaluator to produce enriched, comprehensive evaluations while removing archaic and time consuming steps that can be accelerated with technology. The technology involved automates the production of tailored, personalized and customized narratives in a fraction of the time typically required by administrators to prepare them. Built upon a bedrock of researched based feedback, this system is unlike any other. It introduces processes that enhance interpreter reliability and that encourage co-reflective dialog that will catalyze professional learning communities. The existing prototype will be transferred into a multi-user web based version through this project. The small business requesting this support has the technological and learning science expertise to carry out this ambitious endeavor. Stagnant evaluation processes will become vibrant, dynamic and effective. It not only will improve the practice of STEM teachers but all teachers for which it is utilized. The impact of this research will be both broad and enduring.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Major efforts have been devoted to earthquake research to further our understanding of this natural phenomenon and attempt to reduce its disastrous damage. However, it is not possible to directly observe earthquake processes, because they occur along faults at depths of a few to hundreds of kilometers. The researchers from Oklahoma University have developed an experimental laboratory with tools to duplicate earthquake speeds and offsets on samples of natural rocks. They will partner with a laboratory at Hebrew University that simulate high speed fracturing on acrylics, which are not the same as naturally occurring rocks but can help researchers see aspects of what is happening that could be related to the natural rock experiments. The combination of these sets of complimentary lab experiments will help us to understand how fractures that cause earthquakes and radiates seismic waves. This information is important to improving how we understand seismic hazards because it will advance what we know about strong ground shaking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Oklahoma University team developed an apparatus that physically simulates the velocity and displacement of large earthquakes on experimental rock faults. This team succeeded in reproducing well-known earthquake features of rock weakening and energy consumption. The Hebrew University team has developed unique, high-speed experimental tools that quantitatively measure the extremely fast mechanical evolution of the rupture of a "laboratory" earthquake. The project will combine the unique capabilities of the two experimental systems for better understanding of earthquake rupture, including detailed description of realistic processes of rock fracturing, friction, and ground shaking. Experimental data on earthquake processes at depth are essential for the derivation of useful models, interpretation of seismic observations, and the evaluation of seismic hazard. The advanced features of the two experimental systems will allow monitoring of rupture along rock-faults at very high resolution, which cannot be achieved for natural earthquakes. It is anticipated that this rupture monitoring will provide the missing links between experiments, theory and seismic concepts, and therefore will significantly advance the understanding of earthquake rupture processes, earthquake energy balance, physics of fault weakening, and the scaling of slip rate, slip magnitude, and seismic hazard.</AbstractNarration>

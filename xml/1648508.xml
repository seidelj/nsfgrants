    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project relates to quantum communication networks being developed to vastly improve network security. The Information Age has had a profound effect on humans and societies across the world. To maintain the benefits afforded by global information access, an improved, long-term solution for secure communications is needed in response to newly emerging cyber threats. Quantum networks, which use the laws of quantum physics to provide secure, encrypted channels that cannot be hacked, can guarantee the long-term security of network communications. The future development and deployment of these ultra-secure quantum networks represents a multi-billion dollar global market that U.S. companies are well positioned to serve. Beyond these economic benefits, the development of quantum networks will advance the development of quantum technologies that can ultimately lead to advanced sensors, faster computational tools, and a better understanding of the true nature of quantum physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a deterministic, on-demand single photon source that will enable quantum networks to be deployed over large areas, something that currently is not possible. The company will prototype a novel quantum source design critical to the realization of quantum teleportation repeaters. These repeaters can enable the long-distance transmission of quantum states and are required for wide-area quantum networks. An on-demand single photon source with a single photon generation probability rate of greater than 20% will be demonstrated in this Phase I effort. If successful, this scalable design offers a direct path to the higher single-photon generation probability rates required for successful integration and demonstration of quantum teleportation repeaters.</AbstractNarration>

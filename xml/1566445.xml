    <AbstractNarration>Professor Chia-Kuang Tsung of Boston College is supported by the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Division of Chemistry to develop a new type of heterogeneous catalytic system, whereby colloidal nanoparticles are embedded within crystalline nanoporous metal-organic framework (MOF) materials. The research seeks to alter the size, structure, and chemical environment of the catalytic cavities in order to control the catalytic activity and selectivity. The long-term objective for this research is to use this new concept to design catalysts for a wide range of reactions. The catalytic study is carried out via a collaboration with Professor Wenyu Huang of Iowa State University. Success in this endeavor enhances the understanding of molecular behavior at the interface between nanopore and metal surfaces and facilitates the development of heterogeneous catalysts for industrial uses from manufacturing of fine chemicals, petrochemicals, and agrochemicals to producing liquid fuels. Graduate and undergraduate students at the two institutions acquire valuable skills in building catalytic nanostructures and in instrumental characterization of nanostructures and their use in catalysis. High school teachers in the Boston area are educated in nanoscience and catalysis to enhance their science education programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this work, a synthetic strategy for the development of new hybrid heterogeneous catalytic systems, whereby colloidal nanoparticles are embedded within crystalline nanoporous MOF materials, are developed. The structures are subjected to a battery of surface characterization techniques including chemisorption, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), and low energy transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with electron diffraction tomography (EDT). Selective acetylene hydrogenation, selective hydrogenation of alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes, and selective cyclic aromatic hydrogenations are systematically tested to verify the validity of the approach. The long-term objective for this research is to use this new concept to design catalysts for a wide range of reactions. Success in this endeavor enhances the understanding of molecular behavior for the development of heterogeneous catalysts for industrial uses from manufacturing of fine chemicals, petrochemicals, and agrochemicals to producing liquid fuels.</AbstractNarration>

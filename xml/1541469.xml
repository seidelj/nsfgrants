    <AbstractNarration>Modern research in biological, physical, earth, and environmental sciences is dependent on computational methodologies that require high-speed data transfer within and between research institutions. This award provides critical upgrades to the Portland State University (PSU) network infrastructure required to support big-data projects. PSU is committed to conducting cutting-edge scientific research and to offering research opportunities for minorities and underrepresented groups in the STEM disciplines through programs such as the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, the McNair Scholars Program, and a BUILD grant from the NIH. Students from these programs are placed directly into active research labs. This project provides researchers opportunities to conduct data-driven research with cutting edge network technology and strengthens the diverse portfolio of research conducted at PSU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award implements the PSU campus Research And Innovation Network (RAIN) infrastructure and the creation of a Science DMZ. These upgrades eliminate current bottlenecks, provide the architecture required to support future upgrades to 40Gbps and 100Gbps, and provide Software Defined Networking (SDN) capability to support dynamic data workflows. RAIN provides high bandwidth networking between research facilities in the Science Research and Teaching Building, Cramer Hall, Engineering Building, and the Collaborative Life Sciences Building shared with Oregon Health Sciences University and Oregon State University research groups. The Science DMZ provides a friction-free path to Oregon GigaPop and Internet2, as well as allowing broader use of Shibboleth to support campus-bridging efforts to improve resource sharing between researchers at PSU and their collaborators.</AbstractNarration>

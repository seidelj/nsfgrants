    <AbstractNarration>Historically, the study of "special functions" originated in the fact that quite a few functions of interest in applications turned out to be members of a single family, the hypergeometric functions; more recently, the Painleve transcendents have also begun to play a significant role in applications. Under previous grants, the investigator constructed and studied so-called "elliptic" analogues of these functions (a significant generalization that includes most of the generalized hypergeometric functions and generalized Painleve transcendents in the literature), as well as their implications for the more classical special functions. The current project continues this work, and aims to provide a more solid conceptual framework by relating elliptic special functions to noncommutative algebraic geometry, which is a relatively recent variant of algebraic geometry, one of the fundamental disciplines within mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This connection is based on a new construction of noncommutative rational surfaces in terms of difference operators on elliptic curves (giving a discrete analogue of D-module theory), giving rise to a (functorial) relation between linear elliptic difference equations and sheaves on the noncommutative surfaces. The Painleve equations (and generalizations) are most naturally interpreted as flows in moduli spaces of differential equations, so one expects their elliptic analogues to be related to moduli spaces of difference equations, and thus to moduli spaces of sheaves. In particular, the investigator expects to be able to leverage the existing literature on noncommutative algebraic geometry to understand the structure of such moduli spaces, as well as various natural maps between them (e.g., twisting by line bundles). In addition, since the new construction of highly-blown-up noncommutative rational surfaces is considerably more concrete than the previously existing constructions, the investigator expects the project to contribute significantly to our understanding of such surfaces in their own right (as well as their derived categories). Finally, several of the difference operators that arise in the construction are univariate analogues of operators that appeared in earlier work of the investigator on elliptic analogues of Macdonald-Koornwinder polynomials; this leads to a multivariate analogue of the construction with connections not just to those elliptic analogues but also to certain integrable systems and to an elliptic analogue of the "double affine Hecke algebras" of Cherednik.</AbstractNarration>

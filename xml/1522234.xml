    <AbstractNarration>This project will support forty (40) two-year college economics faculty (twenty teams of two faculty members each year) to attend the 2016 and 2017 American Economic Association's (AEA) annual Conference on Teaching and Research in Economic Education (CTREE). The annual CTREE conferences have become the focus of efforts to improve student learning of economics in higher education. In addition to bringing two-person teams of faculty to CTREE, the project will require each faculty participant to complete a curriculum redesign project. The forty completed redesign projects will be posted for public use at the Science Education Resource Center website, Economics at Community Colleges which is part of the online portal called Starting Point: Teaching and Learning Economics (that can be entered at http://serc.carleton.edu/econ/index.html). A follow-on workshop will identify new economics two-year faculty leadership who will work with representatives of the AEA to sustain two-year faculty involvement with CTREE and other AEA teaching and learning projects.</AbstractNarration>

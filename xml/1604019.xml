<AbstractNarration>The co-production of valuable chemicals and materials can improve the economic viability of bio-refinery processes that convert renewable biomass resources into biofuels.  To serve as a forum for emerging bio-refinery concepts, the fourth scientific conference in the Frontiers in Biorefining series, titled Chemicals and Materials from Renewable Carbon, will be held during November 2016, at St. Simons Island, Georgia.  This conference will assemble scientists and engineers from around the world to share recent progress, explore information needs, and present ideas that advance integrated bio-refinery concepts. A total of 90 participants from academia, government, and industry are expected. This award will support the travel of five graduate student researchers to present their original research at the conference, and to network with influential scientific and industrial researchers in the field of biorefining.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As research programs continue to build the body of fundamental science that create new bio-refinery concepts, a scientific conference to facilitate networking, exchange ideas, and further collaboration between scientists and research institutions is timely. The opening plenary session will highlight key developments in emerging bio-refinery concepts by invited scientists. The subsequent technical program emphasizes pathways for conversion of biomass to useful and valuable chemicals and materials in six parallel sessions and a student poster reception.  Specific sessions are:  Engineered feedstocks for the bio-refinery; Cell wall deconstruction and biomass fractionation; Catalytic conversion of lignin; Catalytic conversion of carbohydrates; Biochemical conversion of carbohydrates and lignin; Catalytic thermochemical conversion of whole biomass; The interface of biomass and petrochemicals.  An open-access, peer-reviewed paper will summarize the activities at the conference in an effort to guide future research, funding opportunities, and policymaking in the fields of biorefining and bioenergy.</AbstractNarration>

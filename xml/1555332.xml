    <AbstractNarration>Today's mobile communications technology will soon become obsolete in the face of increasing demand for broadband data and wireless access. Since the advent of cellular and WiFi wireless technologies, wireless communications have used relatively narrowband radio channels, with relatively low ultra-high frequencies (UHF), and unsophisticated antennas. This project offers to provide fundamental knowledge about the radio channels in a much higher frequency range, where orders of magnitude more data capacity could be delivered to cellphones of the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tremendous pending demand for wireless capacity is causing regulators around the world to consider opening up new mobile spectrum in the millimeter wave (mm-wave) frequency bands. To date, little is known about the small-scale behavior of mm-Wave radio channels, yet academia and industry require small-scale channel models to create new wireless system architectures and air interface standards that will use directional antennas for the first time. In this project, comprehensive 28 GHz small-scale propagation measurements in an urban setting (Brooklyn, NY) shall uncover key small scale multipath and signal properties that are currently not known or understood. The data will allow for the development of analytical and statistical channel models that are based on directional antennas. Such measurements and models are critical for the proper engineering analysis and design of future mm-wave physical layer and link layer protocols by both academia and industry, and the knowledge from this project could also lead to simulation and emulation products for fifth generation (5G) wireless product development.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary research project will examine whether social and geographical disparities exist during the four phrases of emergency management (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery). The investigators will use multiple perspectives and scales to address the research questions, including analysis at the community, individual, and organizational scales. Findings from this project will provide valuable insights into the interplay among regional disparities, individual social networks and behavior, and governmental/organizational policies. This project will expand knowledge of whether social media use may serve to overcome or further deepen the social and geographical disparities in each phase of emergency management. The project will enhance understanding of how to conduct efficient mining of social media data in order to produce useful and valid scientific information, thereby advancing both social science and information science research by developing and testing algorithms that can be used to mine noisy and imperfect data from sources like Twitter. The knowledge gained from this project will help develop strategies to reduce disparities, create effective social media campaigns and emergency management outreach, and promote resilience to disasters. The methods used in this project will be applicable to study other disasters in other regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the sources, patterns, and consequences of social and geographical disparities in disaster resilience is critical to building long-term resilient, healthy, and sustainable communities. Traditional resilience analysis has been confined mostly to the use of static data collected at scheduled intervals. With the advent of the "Big Data" era, real-time human response data extracted from social media could provide new opportunities for studying disparities in disaster resilience. The investigators will compare Twitter data from two events, Hurricane Isaac and Hurricane Sandy, both of which occurred in 2012. They will pursue four interrelated research components: (1) development of data-mining algorithms for the evaluation and visualization of Twitter data; (2) analysis of social media and resilience disparities at the community (zip-code) level across the emergency management cycle; (3) an online survey of Twitter and non-Twitter users to understand effects of social media use on individual resilience, social networks, social support, and social disparities; and (4) analysis of bi-directional communication among residents and governmental and non-governmental organizations throughout each event cycle. Through an investigation of the Twitter data before, during, and after the hurricanes coupled with analysis of online surveys, the researchers will be able to address a set of core research questions: (1) Are there distinct geographical and social disparities in the use of social media in disaster resilience? (2) What are the sources and consequences of such disparities? (3) How do these disparities vary across the four phases of the disaster cycle? (4) How do these disparities affect resilience? (5) How can social media data be used to improve resilience? This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.</AbstractNarration>

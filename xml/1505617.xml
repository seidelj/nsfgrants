    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Prior NSF support resulted in a technique to measure, and even to image, distortion of microwave frequency electrical signals in superconducting devices. This project refines the technique, uses it to understand the origin of electrical distortion, and explores opportunities to apply controlled distortion to future technologies. Electrical distortion also provides insight into the underlying physics of superconductors, and the Hope College undergraduate microwave research laboratory has discovered some key distinctions in the physics of the two broad categories of distortion: even and odd distortion. In-depth experiments with this NSF supported discovery are a key component of this project. Domestic and international collaborations, involving experts in distortion as well as materials fabrication and modification, ensure that this research fits into the larger framework of superconductivity, while also exposing undergraduates to the international and collaborative nature of science. Finally, conclusions about superconductivity can only be drawn if the materials are thoroughly characterized. Therefore, undergraduates are also gaining experience in highly marketable electron and ion beam analysis methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objectives of this project include the spatially resolved raster imaging of microwave nonlinearity in superconducting structures, and the role of magnetic flux vortices in the generation of the even and odd orders of this nonlinearity. Superconducting thin film nonlinearity is being studied with a new technique to locally measure intermodulation distortion, which also permits synchronous determination of each order's current. When combined with laser scanning microscopy, the resistive and inductive components of the nonlinearity are also distinguished. With these methods developed with prior support, the physical mechanisms behind these even and odd order spurious signals, which appear to depend differently on induced vortex matter, are being investigated. This research depends on the availability of a large number of industrially manufactured microstrip devices, of which the PI possesses hundreds. Undergraduates are gaining work experience in transferable skills such as microwave test and measurement, electronic design and analysis, high frequency signal analysis, device fabrication, vacuum and cryogenics, electron microscopy, and ion beam analysis. The program at Hope College, which is also open to students from a nearby regional state university, is one of only a handful of US undergraduate superconductivity research programs with demonstrated longevity.</AbstractNarration>

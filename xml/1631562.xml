    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to support the participation of a select group of US-based PhD students in the doctoral consortium at the 2016 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI). IJCAI is a premier conference in Artificial Intelligence (AI), drawing wide domestic and international participation, including many top researchers. In particular, the doctoral consortium seeks to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in this field of research, and we expect to have diverse participation in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location. In addition to technical exposure, this experience will give students the opportunity to interact with a broad range of researchers and educators involved in the AI field. This will help the students to become members of the international community of scholars, and to develop into the global scientists that are needed for the future. In the longer term, having engaged and informed scientists will help advance science and high-tech industry in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wide variety and significance of the topics typically presented at IJCAI, in both the technical program and the doctoral consortium, will provide a great opportunity for students to share, exchange information, and learn from each other and from the best in the field. Participation in a conference is a great motivator for graduate students, and we expect the IJCAI doctoral consortium will generate additional long-term interest among graduate students in pursuing a research-oriented career in artificial intelligence. Doctoral consortium participants will also have the opportunity to receive feedback on their doctoral research from established scientists who will serve as mentors throughout the proceedings.</AbstractNarration>

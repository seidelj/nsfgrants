    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding support to the Conference in Harmonic Analysis which will be held on March 16-20 on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The conference is devoted to recent developments in harmonic analysis. It will feature 25 talks by leading mathematicians in the field, as well as a number of opportunities for junior participants to share their recent work and learn about open problems. This will be especially beneficial to graduate students and young researchers. Funding will be available to help defray lodging and travel expenses for speakers and junior participants. The organizers will especially encourage the participation of women and members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature recent research results and methods in harmonic analysis. Topics will include oscillatory integrals, Fourier restriction and multiplier problems, the role of affine invariant measures, Wolff inequalities and decoupling, extremizers for inequalities in classical analysis, weighted inequalities, and problems associated with measures on sets of fractional dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information about the conference will be made available at www.math.wisc.edu/ha_2016</AbstractNarration>

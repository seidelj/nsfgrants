<AbstractNarration>As the computing, networking, heterogeneous hardware, and storage&lt;br/&gt;technologies continue to evolve in High-End Computing (HEC) platforms,&lt;br/&gt;it becomes increasingly essential and challenging to understand the&lt;br/&gt;interactions between time-critical High-Performance Computing (HPC)&lt;br/&gt;and Big Data applications, the software infrastructures upon which&lt;br/&gt;they rely for achieving high-performing portable solutions, the&lt;br/&gt;underlying communication fabric these high-performance middlewares&lt;br/&gt;depend on and the schedulers that manage HPC clusters.  Such&lt;br/&gt;understanding will enable all involved parties (application&lt;br/&gt;developers/users, system administrators, and middleware developers) to&lt;br/&gt;maximize the efficiency and performance of the individual components&lt;br/&gt;that comprise a modern HPC system and solve different grand challenge&lt;br/&gt;problems. There is a clear need and unfortunate lack of a high-performance and&lt;br/&gt;scalable tool that is capable of analyzing and correlating the&lt;br/&gt;communication on the fabric with the behavior of HPC/Big Data&lt;br/&gt;applications, underlying middleware and the job scheduler on existing&lt;br/&gt;large HPC systems.  The proposed synergistic and collaborative effort,&lt;br/&gt;undertaken by a team of computer and computational scientists from OSU&lt;br/&gt;and OSC, aims to create an integrated software infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;for high-performance and scalable Fabric Analysis, Monitoring and&lt;br/&gt;Introspection for HPC and Big Data. This tool will achieve the&lt;br/&gt;following objectives: 1) be portable, easy to use and easy to&lt;br/&gt;understand, 2) have high performance and scalable rendering and&lt;br/&gt;storage techniques and, 3) be applicable to the different&lt;br/&gt;communication fabrics and programming models that are likely to be&lt;br/&gt;used on existing large HPC systems and emerging exascale systems.  The&lt;br/&gt;transformative impact of the proposed research and development effort&lt;br/&gt;is to design a comprehensive analysis and performance monitoring tool&lt;br/&gt;for applications of current and next generation multi&lt;br/&gt;petascale/exascale systems to harness the maximum performance and&lt;br/&gt;scalability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research and the associated infrastructure will have a&lt;br/&gt;significant impact on enabling optimizations of HPC and Big Data&lt;br/&gt;applications that have previously been difficult to provide. These&lt;br/&gt;potential outcomes will be demonstrated by using the proposed&lt;br/&gt;framework to validate a variety of HPC and Big Data benchmarks and&lt;br/&gt;applications under multiple scenarios.  The integrated middleware and&lt;br/&gt;tools will be made publicly available to the community through public&lt;br/&gt;repositories and publications in the top forums, enabling other MPI&lt;br/&gt;and Big Data stacks to adopt the designs.  Research results will also&lt;br/&gt;be disseminated to the collaborating organizations of the&lt;br/&gt;investigators to impact their HPC software products and&lt;br/&gt;applications. The proposed research directions and their solutions&lt;br/&gt;will be used in the curriculum of the PIs to train undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, including under-represented minorities and female&lt;br/&gt;students. The technical challenges addressed by the proposal include: 1)&lt;br/&gt;Scalable visualization of large and complex HEC networks so as to&lt;br/&gt;provide a near instant rendering to end users, 2) A generalized data&lt;br/&gt;gathering scheme which is easily portable to multiple communication&lt;br/&gt;fabrics, novel compute architectures and high-performance middleware,&lt;br/&gt;3) Enhanced data storage performance through optimized database&lt;br/&gt;schemas and the use of memory-backed key value stores/databases, 4)&lt;br/&gt;Support in MPI, PGAS, and Big Data libraries to enable the proposed&lt;br/&gt;monitoring, analysis, and introspection framework, and 5) Enabling&lt;br/&gt;deeper introspection of particular regions of application.  The&lt;br/&gt;research will also be driven by a set of HPC and Big Data&lt;br/&gt;applications. The transformative impact of the proposed research and&lt;br/&gt;development effort is to design a comprehensive analysis and&lt;br/&gt;performance monitoring tool for applications of current and next&lt;br/&gt;generation multi petascale/exascale systems to harness the maximum&lt;br/&gt;performance and scalability.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The aim of the triennial workshop on "Advanced Research Workshop on Future Trends in Microelectronics (FTM): Journey Into the Unknown" to be held June 21-26, 2015 in Mallorca, Spain, is to continue the tradition started in 1995 and now reaching the 8th iteration, to provide a forum for a free-spirited exchange of views among the leading professionals in Industry, Academia, and Government. Topics to be addressed include the evolution of microelectronics including not only computing and communications, but extending to sensors, displays, systems, bioelectronics, nanotechnology, and electronics-related material science for the coming decade or more, The speakers are asked to present their own uninhibited views, opinions and critiques of the present and future trends, rather than their own achievements. Debates and critical assessments are encouraged. The resulting free-spirited discussion, with varied and occasionally clashing viewpoints, will be available on the FTM workshop website as well as the conference volume (to be published by Wiley) providing a valuable educational tool for young researchers deciding on promising directions for microelectronics research in the next decade.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Linfield College to support biochemical research with undergraduate students in the chemistry and biology departments with the acquisition of a fast purification liquid chromatography (FPLC) system. A research-grade FPLC system will support cross-disciplinary research and training for a diverse group of undergraduate students, especially in the research areas of mitochondrial transcription protein interactions and protein folding patterns. This cutting edge instrument will strengthen the already robust molecular and cellular biology facilities and encourage the recruitment and retention of high quality faculty teacher-scholars, including those from underrepresented groups. The FPLC instrument will also allow for the development of a research-intensive biochemistry course that has at its core fundamental research into the structure and function of proteins. Thus, acquisition of a FPLC system will allow the chemistry and biology departments to support the education and training of students from biology, chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular biology majors in courses and participate in independent research and summer research as part of Linfield's Student-Faculty Collaborative Research Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has two research areas: 1) understanding regulatory mechanisms of mitochondrial transcription, and 2) investigating how distinct protein folding patterns may affect cellular function. Protein purification is essential to the methods of this project, and the FPLC system from this award will allow for the reproducible purification of the proteins of interest. Specifically, this includes mitochondrial proteins involved in transcription which are then used in an in vitro transcription assay, and conformational variants of the cortactin protein analyzed for functionality in an actin polymerization assay. Multiple methods of protein purification chromatography will be used including anion exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and metal ion affinity chromatography.</AbstractNarration>

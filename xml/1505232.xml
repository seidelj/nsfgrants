    <AbstractNarration>Frequent school absences, pain, malaise, and disease symptoms put chronically ill children at a scholastic disadvantage and render them an underserved educational population. Populations affected by these diseases spend many hours in clinic, hospital and doctor office waiting rooms, places generally bereft of any educational materials. This I-Corps team believes these are significant but unrecognized locales for STEM learning. Waiting time could turn into learning time and problems with compliance could be addressed as children, parents and siblings develop a better understanding of their disease as manifest in the most complex system of all, the human body. In essence, the team proposes creating a model for transforming hospital rooms, doctor's offices and clinics from places where children and their parents wait, to places where they can engage in STEM learning. These are novel settings, informal environments with attentive captive audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to inspire the pediatric patients as well as their siblings to become future researchers, physicians, and engineers who, because of their disease, will develop a true passion for science and math. The proposed BME HeathReach active learning manipulatives and modules can be used and adapted to learners of different ages. BME HealthReach seeks to engage this population, their parents and their siblings by offering innovative science and math learning modules using a child's own disease as the context for learning. Middle school science and math teachers as well, could approach common core standards through the window of disease, often a very compelling entry point.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The ability to sense and detect human movement is critical to the development of data-driven mobile health systems. It can help detect disease and foster behavioral changes to cultivate healthy lifestyles. Existing sensing technologies either require users to constantly wear or carry on-body potentially cumbersome devices, are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference, or present severe privacy risks involving leaking of sensitive data and images. This project takes a entirely different approach to addressing these issues. It exploits the use of ubiquitous light as a low-cost, unobtrusive, and accurate sensing medium capable of simultaneously sensing people and their surrounding context. The proposed vision " LightSense " consists of off-the-shelf LED lights on the ceiling and a few low-cost photodiode sensors sprinkled in the environment. The photodiodes passively capture light blockage created by the human body and reconstruct fine-grained user behaviors in real time. LightSense leverages light to turn a space into a cognitive space, which recognizes our presence, senses our behaviors such as postures and high-level activities while monitoring our health status indicators such as levels of stress. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LightSense is empowered by Visible Light Communication (VLC) that turns the visible light into computational light. It contains the following novel systems and algorithmic designs: 1) a novel VLC network architecture with LED panels and sparse photodiodes to ease system deployment; 2) algorithmic and systems designs to separate light rays from dense LEDs, optimize the placement of photodiodes, and overcome the blockage of other objects (e.g., furniture, other users); 3) a new VLC primitive that allows light communication and sensing to be sustained even under extremely low light conditions; and 4) learning algorithms to infer physical activities, derive movement characteristics, and monitor psychological state. LightSense will be evaluated using real-scale testbeds and user studies. Results from this project will establish the foundational pieces to define a new research space (visible light sensing), and will generate far-reaching impact on promoting innovative interaction designs and enabling new types of precise health monitoring.</AbstractNarration>

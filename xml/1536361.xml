    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides international and domestic travel support for U.S. based graduate student participants to attend the 21st ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2015), which will be held in Sydney, Australia, from August 10-13, 2015. KDD is the world's premier research conference in data mining. It is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers and practitioners from all aspects of data mining, knowledge discovery, and large-scale data analytics. The conference is a highly selective meeting that includes oral and poster presentations of refereed papers as well as panel discussions and invited talks by the leading academic and industrial experts. It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences. Conference proceedings are published by ACM. Besides the technical program, the conference features workshops, tutorials, panels, demonstrations, exhibits, and a data mining contest (KDD Cup). Since 2013, the conference also included a Broadening Participation in Data Mining workshop and we intend to continue this tradition of increasing diversity in data mining. A strong representation of U.S. researchers, particularly students, at the conference is useful in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in this important area today and into the future.</AbstractNarration>

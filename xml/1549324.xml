    <AbstractNarration>Title: Student Travel Support for 43rd ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) 2016&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports student travel to the 2016 ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL). The conference takes place in St. Petersburg, Florida, USA, in January 2016. POPL is a forum for the discussion of leading work on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. The conference has a rich tradition of supporting ideas that have made enduring contributions to the theory, design, implementation or application of programming languages. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader significance and importance includes supporting travel for women and underrepresented minorities, thereby fostering a diverse pool of next generation researchers in this important research area. In particular, students have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.</AbstractNarration>

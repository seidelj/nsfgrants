    <AbstractNarration>In a world that is increasingly quantitative and one in which computers nearly are ubiquitous, it is important that all students learn how to think logically and add fundamental computing skills to their problem solving skills. The expression of this need is underscored by the countless calls for a well-trained STEM workforce, yet, in reality, the fundamental computational skills needed for success in the STEM disciplines are not part of the liberal arts curriculum. The proposed project's significance resides in its leveraging the expertise of computer science and liberal arts educators to develop curricular recommendations that infuse computational thinking into the liberal arts curriculum. This curricular development has the potential to improve the liberal arts workforce and better prepare these students to navigate and contribute to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of proposed project is to identify essential computer science skills that will benefit students in the liberal arts. Relevant literature and current liberal arts curricula and workforce needs will be assessed in order to identify gaps between curricular content and workforce needs. Faculty from computer science and liberal arts will participate in a workshop to discuss the role of computer science skills and principles in the liberal arts and then write and disseminate an informed white paper that will be used to guide future liberal arts curricular development.</AbstractNarration>

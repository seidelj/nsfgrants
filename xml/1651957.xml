<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will pioneer nanoscale chemical processing to achieve complex chemical products, such as, pharmaceuticals, with significantly reduced hazardous waste.  Producing pharmaceuticals generates large amounts of hazardous waste, as much as 100 times more than desired product.  Aggressive solvents account for the majority of waste.  While solvents are necessary for chemical reaction products, their largest quantities are used in product isolation, separation, and purification.  New discoveries in multifunctional reactors capable of reaction and separation will improve process efficiency and reduce waste.  This award supports fundamental research to provide the knowledge needed to develop multifunctional polymer nanoreactors that facilitate accelerated reaction and spontaneous, energy efficient and solvent-free product isolation.  Ultimately, the nanoreactors would lead to efficient and sustainable manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and basic chemicals from biomass.  Advances in sustainable manufacturing technologies will benefit the U.S. economy and society.  The scientific discoveries will be integrated with advanced training in multifunctional nanoreactor technology and sustainable chemical manufacturing for undergraduate and graduate students. The technical training will be coupled with community outreach to broaden participation of underrepresented groups and enhance engineering education through partnering with Higher Achievement of Richmond and the Science Museum of Virginia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to perform conventional unit operations,e.g., fixed bed reactions, and liquid-liquid extractions, on the nanoscale would improve the safety, efficiency and sustainability of liquid phase chemical processing.  This award will investigate a new class of multifunctional polymer nanoreactors that combine reaction and product isolation by spontaneous phase separation. The approach is to self-assemble polymer-nanoparticle catalyst nanoreactors in confined impinging jet mixers. Modular selection of the polymer components will lead to the understanding of (a) how polymer properties affect nanoreactor self-assembly and (b) how polymer/reactant/product interactions affect reaction kinetics and transport.  The nanoreactors will be used for oxidation reactions of increasing complexity to perform multiple reaction and separation steps within a single nanoreactor.  Based on the experimental results, a theoretical model to describe nanoscale chemical processing will be established.</AbstractNarration>

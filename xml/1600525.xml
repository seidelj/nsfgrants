    <AbstractNarration>Pollinators are key to the maintenance of Earth's biodiversity because almost 90% of flowering plants rely on animal pollinators to reproduce. Pollinators are also a vital component of global agriculture, and pollination services by insects are worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Given their importance, it is critical that we develop an understanding of how insect pollinator communities interact with plants across complex landscapes that are often heavily modified by humans. Researchers have recently begun using "network" approaches to study plant-pollinator interactions across entire ecological communities. A plant-pollinator network can be visualized as a "web" of all interactions between pollinators and plants at a given place. By building and evaluating plant-pollinator networks, researchers can, for example, assess whether pollination at a given site will remain stable in the face of disturbance or loss of species. This is especially relevant, considering that human-induced stressors, such as habitat loss and pesticide use, are causing pollinator declines worldwide. This research will use a new genetic approach to determine which plant species are pollinated by which bee species in ten Kansas prairies. Data will be used to construct plant-pollinator networks to assess the potential effect of disturbance and loss of pollinator species on pollination services across human-modified landscapes. As part of this project, the research team will conduct pollinator ecology workshops for middle- and high school students aspiring to be first-generation college graduates. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plant-pollinator networks are typically constructed from observations of insects landing on flowers (i.e., "visitation networks"). Few researchers have evaluated these insects for the presence and species identities of pollen carried between flowers; doing so based on pollen morphology is especially time-consuming. In this project, investigators will use metabarcoding to identify pollen carried by native bees collected across ten study sites. Several structural properties of the resulting pollen transport networks will be compared to the properties of networks based on visitation data alone. Investigators predict that: A) pollen transport networks will exhibit greater network-level specialization than visitation networks, and B) pollen transport networks will be less nested than visitation networks, indicating that plant-pollinator interactions could be more susceptible to species loss than the visitation data, alone, would suggest.</AbstractNarration>

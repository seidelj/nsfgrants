    <AbstractNarration>The connection between the quantum world controlled by microscopic forces and the macroscopic world that dominates our everyday lives is not well understood. Macroscopic systems exhibit universal behavior that cannot depend sensitively on microscopic details, but is believed to be subject to powerful and general principles of organization. Universal behavior is seen in a variety of systems of interest across many branches of physics including the quark-gluon plasma of the early universe, high temperature superconductivity and ultracold Fermi gases in the laboratory. In this project, the P.I. will investigate the emergence of these powerful forces that give rise to the collective behavior of macroscopic systems. The plan is to perform a systematic study of properties as a function of system size, focusing on an intermediate regime called the mesoscopic region where quantum mechanics and classical mechanics merge. Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate fully in this research, including communicating the results through papers and talks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goal of this study is to elucidate the driving forces behind this emerging universal behavior and to propose new ways to observe and control this behavior in the laboratory. In the last decade, the atomic physics community has taken advantage of cooling and trapping techniques to create and control finite-size systems of ultracold gases that exhibit universal properties. This work will focus on Fermi gases and utilize a perturbation method that yields exact first-order results for all system sizes simultaneously. By studying trends as a function of system size for properties such as excitation frequencies and thermodynamic quantities recently measured in the laboratory, the goal is to uncover signatures of emerging collective behavior in order to understand the dynamics of this fundamental transition.</AbstractNarration>

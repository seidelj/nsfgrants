<AbstractNarration>This project increase the accessibility of scientific knowledge by creating  a cross-referenced repository of scientific assertions, metrics and indicators of research impact and trends, and tools for accessing and exploring scientific knowledge. The project expands the scope of the study of scientific knowledge by directly addressing the integral role of uncertainties and discrepancies in understanding and communicating scientific knowledge. The observatory tracks how a scientific assertion evolves over time in the scientific literature. The project advances the capabilities of the study of scientific knowledge by providing references so that researchers can routinely and systematically compare and evaluate metrics and algorithms designed to capture the impact of scientific contributions. The increased accessibility of scientific knowledge improves research productivity as well as the understanding of science and relevant policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project represents scientific knowledge as a semantically organized and adaptive network of scientific assertions, structures of reasoning and argumentation, and relevant evidence extracted from the growing body of scientific literature. Extracted concepts, semantic relations, and argumentative structures are synthesized across scientific publications using techniques from machine learning, computational linguistics, quantitative studies of science, and visual analytics. In addition, uncertainties and discrepancies associated with scientific assertions and their impacts are identified and cross-referenced in the repository so as to keep track of their evolution over time. Existing and newly developed metrics and indicators of research impact are linked directly to assertion-level evidence and patterns.  The observatory serves as a sustainable platform for researchers and tool developers to access scientific knowledge and relevant resources for conducting their own studies and evaluating the quality of new metrics and algorithms in the broad context of the science of science and innovation policy research.</AbstractNarration>

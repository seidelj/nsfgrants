    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Optofluidic Lasers at the Liquid-Liquid Interface: A Versatile Biosensing&lt;br/&gt;Platform&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Goals&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project investigates bio compatible and bio configurable optofluidic&lt;br/&gt;lasers that are self assembled at the liquid-liquid interface and explores their&lt;br/&gt;transformative applications in bioscience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER project integrates research, educational, and outreach components to&lt;br/&gt;lead the innovations in both optofluidic lasers and biosensing technologies in&lt;br/&gt;healthcare. The novel approach is enabled by multidisciplinary integration of&lt;br/&gt;photonics, microfluidics, MEMS, and bionanotechnologies that creates a new&lt;br/&gt;modality of all liquid laser array that can be controlled and configured by&lt;br/&gt;bio/chemical molecules and fluids.&lt;br/&gt;The project includes prominent interdisciplinary education and training&lt;br/&gt;components for undergraduate and graduate students. Plans are also in place to&lt;br/&gt;promote involvement of underrepresented students, which leverages the UTA's&lt;br/&gt;status as one of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority&lt;br/&gt;Serving Institutions. Special attention is paid to recruit and retain female students in&lt;br/&gt;engineering. Finally, the proposed project has extensive outreach programs to train&lt;br/&gt;high school students and engineering teachers and to disseminate knowledge and&lt;br/&gt;research discoveries to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this CAREER project is to develop an array of bio compatible and&lt;br/&gt;bio configurable optofluidic lasers that are self assembled at the liquid liquid&lt;br/&gt;interface and study this novel optofluidic laser enabled versatile biosensing&lt;br/&gt;technology platform to achieve exceptional detection sensitivity, selectivity, and&lt;br/&gt;throughput in various biological and biomedical sensing applications. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;optofluidic laser features a monolayer laser gain material (i.e., only a few&lt;br/&gt;nanometers thick) confined at the liquid liquid interface, which allows biological&lt;br/&gt;and biochemical molecules to access and directly modulate the laser gain material,&lt;br/&gt;and thus forms the basis of enhanced detection sensitivity and selectivity. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed laser sensing platform is studied for rapid and low cost multiplexed&lt;br/&gt;cancer biomarker detection towards a final goal of addressing current challenges in&lt;br/&gt;the point of care medical diagnostics and health monitoring. The outcomes&lt;br/&gt;generated from this research will lead to new development and discoveries in the&lt;br/&gt;field of bioinspired optofluidic devices and engineering, as well as fundamental&lt;br/&gt;research on extreme sensing and extreme photonics.</AbstractNarration>

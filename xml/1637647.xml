    <AbstractNarration>Legged vehicles have long intrigued us with the promise of moving with animal-like agility, gracefully and swiftly going where wheeled vehicles cannot. Despite numerous successes, however, current legged robots are mostly unable to traverse rough terrain, and are mechanically complex, requiring elaborate hardware and control, and having short operation-times. Work on this project will investigate the development of multi-legged robots that utilize adaptive motors and transmissions, to reduce the complexity and cost, while also allowing the legs to adapt to rough terrain. These legged robot designs will be made freely available through OpenRobotHardware.org, and will be able to be easily and inexpensively fabricated with rapid prototyping techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project takes a new approach to legged robots by proposing new architectures that reduce over-constraint in the closed kinematic chains with the ground by applying under-actuated mechanisms - equipping robots with legs that passively adapt to large variations in terrain roughness with minimal disturbance forces to the body. As a result of this kind of passive adaptability, the robot is able to find a stable footing on rough terrain without any sensing or planning: the legs simply fall into place. Furthermore, adaptability in the mechanism also enables the forces and torques applied by the legs to the body to be passively regulated so as to minimize disturbances that would tend to destabilize the vehicle or cause it to lose its heading. This ability will drastically simplify the control of legged robot systems, greatly increase power efficiency and their robustness to terrain variations, and decrease production and maintenance costs.</AbstractNarration>

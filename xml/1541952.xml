    <AbstractNarration>The field of Adaptive Optics has made tremendous advances in the last decade. For many years it was exclusively used for real-time correction of the effects of atmospheric turbulence in images produced by telescopes. Over the past few years, however, the application of Adaptive Optics has broadened with the technology. Nowadays, Adaptive Optics is not only employed in astronomical and vision science applications; but it is also used in microscopy, X-ray beam control, and line-of-site communication. The future generation of giant telescopes will rely on advanced Adaptive Optics, making this technology even more essential to the scientific enterprise. It is therefore particularly important to support interdisciplinary research in this promising area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for the 2015 Adaptive Optics Topical Meeting, to be held in Arlington, VA, between 7-11 June, 2015. The meeting will bring together experts working in the many disciplines that develop adaptive optics, including both academia and industry. The workshop is designed to encourage interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration, and to serve as an effective platform to educate students, future scientists and engineers in multidisciplinary fields. The meeting will permit the dissemination of recent technological developments and novel applications in the field, exchange and stimulate ideas, advance innovation in adaptive optics, and provide a showcase on control algorithms.</AbstractNarration>

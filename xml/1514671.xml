    <AbstractNarration>This research will test the persistence of the Ebola virus on various material surfaces, environmental settings and types of biological samples, as well as test the efficacy of common household disinfectants in decontaminating these materials. Understanding how a pathogen survives on a surface and in the environment is critical to minimizing and stopping the spread of an infectious disease. Inanimate items contaminated with Ebola virus, such as bedding, furniture, and clothing, could play a major role in the spread of disease and yet there is surprisingly very little information known about the stability of the Ebola virus outside of a host organism. This research will have immediate impacts on the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak. It may reveal previously unknown sources of infection and in turn, offer new strategies to prevent viral exposure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will utilize a biologically contained Ebola virus model system that they have previously developed. In this model system, the Ebola virus has been modified and lacks the gene that encodes for an essential viral protein. The resulting modified virus is morphologically indistinguishable from the authentic virus, yet it is non-pathogenic to animals such as mice, guinea pigs and nonhuman primates so that the research can be conducted in a biosafety level-3 containment facility. The research will determine the viral persistence on common household surfaces such as glass, metal and plastic, environmental materials such as water, soil, and sewage, as well as biological materials such as stool, urine, blood and vomit. Researchers will assess the viral persistence for different incubation periods, as well as for variable levels of temperature and humidity. Furthermore, the efficacy of common disinfectants will be tested in the model system. Results from this research will provide critical information for the current Ebola virus outbreak and will help curtail the spread of Ebola virus in the future.</AbstractNarration>

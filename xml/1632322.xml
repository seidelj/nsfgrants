    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate advancement in high-mobility materials. These materials are being increasingly used in the electronics device industry. This project's goal is to enable better devices by providing complete data on the effects of manufacturing processes and better enabling their optimization. Innovative electronic device structures such as faster computer chips, and more powerful RF circuits require development of smaller and smaller devices employing more advanced materials. The innovation that is being advanced through this Phase II program directly impacts this development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a deployable system to directly measure high-resolution mobility, resistivity, and carrier concentration profiles for high-mobility semiconductor materials. Current electrical profiling methods provide partial data for these material systems that form the basis of the multi-billion dollar semiconductor logic device and RF/power chip industries. The objectives of this Phase II program are to further demonstrate a prototype by developing and integrating high-reliability sub-systems to build a beta-level measurement tool with nm-level resolution. This is expected to reduce the semiconductor wafer area needed to evaluate high-mobility materials, and develop the measurement capability to target all high-mobility materials with potential applications in IC and RF/power industries.</AbstractNarration>

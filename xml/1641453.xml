    <AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to conduct an oceanographic research cruise on the R/V Atlantis dedicated&lt;br/&gt;to leadership development for 24 Early Career Scientists (ECS). Novel to this proposal are&lt;br/&gt;the use of the National Deep Submergence Facility assets Alvin and Sentry, research telepresence between the Inner Space Center (ISC) University of Rhode Island and R/V Atlantis, and a science communication component. Mentors include four senior scientists with extensive experience&lt;br/&gt;in deep-submergence science and one science communications expert. Key development objectives for the ECS include experience in i) planning and executing collaborative, interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;research, ii) leadership in cruise and dive/mission planning and execution, iii) integrating instrumentation with Alvin/Sentry/other deep-submergence assets; iv) telepresence-enabled data acquisition and seafloor-to-ship-to-shore communications, v) data management, sharing, reporting, and vi) science communication and outreach to broader audiences.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The deep-ocean remains largely a hidden library of knowledge for us to probe and understand,&lt;br/&gt;and deep-sea ecosystems and ecosystem services remain poorly understood even as they are increasingly subject to anthropogenic change through resource extraction, waste disposal, acidification,&lt;br/&gt;warming, etc. For the US to remain a leader in deep-ocean science, there is need to train&lt;br/&gt;the next generation of leaders in deep-ocean research. This proposed effort builds on recent&lt;br/&gt;shore-based leadership development efforts, including the 2015 Alvin New Users Workshop and&lt;br/&gt;annual DeSSC (Deep Submergence Science Committee) workshop for early-career scientists.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The proposed cruise will benefit 24 early-career scientists with interests in deep-ocean research using National Deep Submergence Facility assets, providing them with experience in pre-cruise and at-sea leadership and decision-making, ship and shore practice in telepresence-enabled research, and science communication, as well as post-cruise follow-up opportunities. Participants should attain an enhanced ability to prepare competitive proposals to lead shipboard science&lt;br/&gt;and have expanded their interdisciplinary network. Outcomes from the program will be reported by participants at the annual early-career workshop and DeSSC meeting, may be reported at&lt;br/&gt;a special session at the fall AGU meeting, and disseminated in on-line documents on DeSSC webpages, and elsewhere. Basic assessment tools will document learning outcomes and inform subsequent deep-submergence training programs.</AbstractNarration>

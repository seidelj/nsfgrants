    <AbstractNarration>This travel grant will support for US-based participants at the first meeting on Algebraic Vision to be held at the Technical University in Berlin from October 8-9, 2015. Algebraic Vision is an emerging research area at the intersection of computer vision and mathematics that seeks to develop the algebro-geometric foundations of fundamental geometric problems that arise in the reconstruction of 3-dimensional scenes and cameras from noisy 2-dimensional images. This structural understanding will allow the possibility of designing specialized algorithms for the many practical problems in vision on the one hand, while also exposing pure mathematicians to rich and structured algebraic problems that arise in applications. This exchange has the potential to benefit and enrich computer vision, algebraic geometry and polynomial optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the meeting is to initiate connections between researchers in computer vision, algebraic geometry and polynomial optimization so as to identify a core set of problems that can benefit from established tools in the three fields. For this purpose, the meeting agenda will revolve around short talks by experts from both sides with plenty of time in between for discussions. Young researchers will have the opportunity to be exposed to this new exchange of problems and ideas which will create the possibility of training a new generation with a common set of sophisticated and useful skills from these three closely related fields.</AbstractNarration>

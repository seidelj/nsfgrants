    <AbstractNarration>The Tech Topology Conference is a conference held annually in December at the Georgia Institute of Technology, with the upcoming meeting scheduled for December 4-6, 2015. The mathematical focus of the conference is on the fields of topology and geometry. The greatest impact of the conference comes from its emphasis on the Southeast region of the US, especially on the junior researchers in this area. Besides bringing a high profile conference to the area and allowing local researchers to interact with leading mathematicians from across the country, the Tech Topology Conference provides a platform for the promotion and advancement of the mathematics being done in the Southeast region. Indeed, half of the speakers in the first four conferences have been from the Southeast, and one third have been junior researchers. With the 2015 conference, the organizers will introduce a 5-minute lightning talk session, allowing the conference to feature even more of the work being done - especially by junior researchers - in the Southeast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Tech Topology Conference is a annual conference series at Georgia Institute of Technology that started in 2011. The main aims of the conference are: (1) to provide a high-profile Geometry-Topology conference to the Southeast that brings leaders in the field to the area as well as showcases the high quality mathematics being done in the Southeast and (2) to provide a convenient meeting place for Southeastern researchers and students to gather, discuss, research, and interact with leading mathematicians from across the country. The Tech Topology Conference focuses on several areas of Geometry and Topology, all in line with the interests of the Geometry and Topology faculty at the Georgia Institute of Technology. In the past there have been lectures on 3-manifolds, dynamics, knots, and geometric group theory, to name a few. In inviting speakers, the emphasis is on researchers in the Southeast, especially junior researchers. For speakers and participants alike, the Tech Topology Conference provides a critical venue for researchers in the Southeast to interact with leaders in the field from around the country and to share their work. Mathematical progress is integral to the whole idea of the Tech Topology Conference: the organizers provide ample time for the participants to meet, formally and informally, to discuss mathematics. Beginning in 2015 we there will be a lunchtime session consisting of 5-minute talks, enabling the conference to feature even more of the work being done in the Southeast. The organizers post notes from the conference talks on the conference web site, making much of the mathematical content of the conference available publicly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is ttc.gatech.edu</AbstractNarration>

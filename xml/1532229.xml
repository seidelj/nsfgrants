    <AbstractNarration>An award is made to Chapman University to acquire a cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer for research in wetland carbon cycling. The acquisition of a CRDS analyzer will increase opportunities for research training by leveraging a number of existing mentoring and teaching programs at Chapman University, an undergraduate-serving institution in Orange, California. These include mentored undergraduate research; integration into an existing Ecosystem Ecology laboratory course; use in an established research training program for local high school students; and training of community college students supported by an ongoing NSF REU-Site program. These training efforts will continue a successful track record of engaging females and underrepresented minorities in cutting edge scientific research using world-class instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wetlands are among the most important ecosystems in the global carbon cycle because of their large soil carbon pools and high methane emissions. Given their importance in the global carbon cycle, wetlands have been important drivers of climate change in the past. A pressing question in global change biogeochemistry remains whether a significant fraction of the large carbon pool in wetland soils will be released as methane in future climates. A more complete mechanistic understanding of the complex microbial processes that mediate wetland carbon cycling is necessary to accurately model the response of wetland decomposition and methane dynamics to ongoing global change. Stable isotopes are a powerful tool for exploring wetland carbon cycling and can provide important insights into the production and consumption of methane in wetlands. The acquisition of a cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzer will allow for the measurement of stable isotopic composition of carbon dioxide and methane. The acquired instrument will provide important insights into the processes of decomposition, methane production and methane consumption in wetland ecosystems to better understand their role in the global carbon cycle.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Non-Technical: This NSF/FDA Scholar-in-Residence Program award by the Biomaterials Program to University of Michigan is to develop and evaluate tools for detecting bacterial colonization and antibiotic resistance associated with medical devices including soft materials. Healthcare associated infections exact an enormous toll (100,000 deaths and $28-33 billion per year) on our society. Early detection of bacterial colonization and antibiotic resistance would provide tremendous benefits to clinicians and patients to save lives and costs associated with these infections. This project will develop and evaluate tools based on molecular techniques and imaging tools to detect early bacterial colonization and soft materials on soft materials and other medical devices. The long term goal of this project is to develop such tools for clinician to use for non-invasive and rapid diagnostics; therefore, then provide immediate appropriate treatment for patients. The project will provide great opportunities for research education because it is so interdisciplinary, combining methods from material science, biology, and optical sciences and engineering. Success of this project will have a big impact to protect public health. This research will be integrated with teaching and training of post-graduate and undergraduate students in these areas, and particularly will provide extensive experience to trainees while working at both academia and federal agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical: Microbial colonization of medical devices including soft materials is thought to lead to many healthcare associated infections. Better and early clinical diagnostics are needed to: 1) detect and quantify medical device colonization; and 2) assess the degree to which bacteria are developing resistance to antibiotics. In response to these calls and urgent needs, this project aims to develop and evaluate the potential of molecular and imaging diagnostics tools for detecting biofilms on dermal filler materials and related drug resistance. The investigator will first identify potential colonization and biofilm specific markers using RNA-Seq techniques and develop specific molecular probes for these markers. The project is expected in developing imaging tools such as optical coherence tomography and confocal laser scanning microscopy in combination with molecular probes in assessing early bacterial colonization/biofilm formation on dermal soft materials in vitro. The researcher expects that developing and understanding on how to use these tools in vitro/in vivo could lead to further development of clinically relevant diagnostic tools. The study would provide a strong foundation for further development of these promising diagnostic tools for quick detection of biofilms in vivo and provide clinician a quick and versatile tool to examine patients after plastic surgery. The primary goal is to protect patients especially women with medical devices and implants, and to provide scientific evidence and tools that will assist physicians and regulators to address this public health issue. The project will provide training of postgraduate and undergraduate students through research and internship programs. These trainees will benefit from working collaboratively at both academic laboratories and federal agencies.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in its ability to implement multiple-input&lt;br/&gt;multiple-output (MIMO) detectors of any size. This, in turn, impacts the broad needs of wireless&lt;br/&gt;communications industry that is always in search of more efficient use of the scarce spectral resources.&lt;br/&gt;Since its invention 15 years ago, MIMO has been included in all wireless standards, e.g. WiFi,&lt;br/&gt;WiMAX, and LTE. As of today, MIMO products of sizes up to 4x4 (i.e. 4 transmit and 4 receive&lt;br/&gt;antennas) have appeared in the market, while the most recent standards, such as IEEE 802.11ac WiFi&lt;br/&gt;and LTE-Advanced cellular, have specified MIMO sizes as large as 8x8. For WiFi this can mean more&lt;br/&gt;effective hot-spots in public and workplace settings. For cellular this can mean improved connectivity&lt;br/&gt;in rural areas with fewer base-station towers, having a positive economic impact. Industry activities&lt;br/&gt;that attempt to build larger MIMO systems such as 16x16 are occurring. Massive MIMO networks with&lt;br/&gt;more than 100 antennas at the base stations have recently been proposed for 5G cellular and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;These trends indicate a large market opportunity for the scalable MIMO technology that this project&lt;br/&gt;builds upon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 2 project plans to develop and&lt;br/&gt;commercialize a set of intellectual property (IP) software-codes/IP-cores related to multiple-input&lt;br/&gt;multiple-output (MIMO) communications. These cores address the needs of wireless chipset&lt;br/&gt;manufacturers. The main hurdle in the design and implementation of MIMO systems is their&lt;br/&gt;complexity which drives cost and power consumption. The complexity of an optimal MIMO detector&lt;br/&gt;grows exponentially with the number of transmit antennas. The same is true for most of the near&lt;br/&gt;optimal MIMO detectors that have been suggested in the literature and adopted by industry. This&lt;br/&gt;limitation has been the main impediment in developing commercial MIMO systems that support larger&lt;br/&gt;array sizes with increased range and data rate. This project adopts a novel technology that achieves near&lt;br/&gt;optimal performance having complexity that only grows linearly with the number of transmit antennas.&lt;br/&gt;It thus can be used to implement MIMO systems of any size, at an affordable complexity.</AbstractNarration>

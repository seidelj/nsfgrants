    <AbstractNarration>Coral reef ecosystems host some of the highest biodiversity of life per unit area on Earth and harbor about one quarter to one third of all marine animals. Reef-associated animals are a major source of protein for millions of people, and reefs offer shoreline protection and provide a significant source of tourism revenue, especially in developing countries. Factors that influence supply and settlement of young (larval) fish, coral, and associated animals can have large impacts on reef ecosystem and population structure, and learning more about these can help improve understanding of how to maintain the benefits provided by coral reefs. This study will lead to a detailed, mechanistic understanding of how young larvae use natural sounds to orient toward, locate, and select preferred settlement habitat. The approach will combine detailed field measurements and experiments to isolate key soundscape variables that impact coral reef larvae. The results will be broadly distributed to the scientific community and the public through open-access articles, media releases, blogs and website updates. Graduate and undergraduate students will be directly involved in all aspects of the research and outreach. This project will leverage a skilled communications department, the Cape Cod summer community, a community outreach center in a national park and marine protected area, and the public's interest in coral reefs to broaden the awareness of marine ecology through: (a) public presentations in a summer seminar series, (b) direct communication and interaction with journalists and teachers, and (c) education in local schools for preschool, grade-school and college students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For marine communities, such as those on coral reefs, factors influencing larval supply and settlement can have major impacts on community structure and population replenishment. There are now some indications that sound plays an important role in attracting larvae to suitable settlement habitat. There is little understanding of what soundscape habitat information is available to larvae and how differences and variability in sound can influence settlement. This project will include comprehensive experiments, environmental measurements, and modeling with the goal of understanding the role of sound in influencing larval recruitment and local biodiversity. The investigators will measure in situ settlement of larval fish and coral in relation to different soundscapes and habitat conditions in a marine protected area using traditional larval sampling methods, moored acoustic recorders, and a suite of environmental observations. Controlled and calibrated environmental playback experiments will isolate soundscape components and determine specific and fundamental acoustic cues larvae use to orient and settle. The spatial and temporal variability of soundscape cues and components across reef habitats will be established. Finally, the project will determine the relevant ranges of sound plumes that larvae may encounter through direct measurements of the sound fields of multiple reefs.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Professors Torsten Hegmann, Michael J. Tubergen, and colleagues at Kent State University host the REU Site at Kent State University: Liquid Crystals and Advanced Materials. The Site is co-located in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry as well as the Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI) at Kent State University (KSU). This site is funded by the REU Site Programs of the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Materials Research, both in the NSF Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. The research projects supported bring a diverse group of students from two and four year institutions, including institutions serving primarily students of color, from various parts of the country to KSU to interact with a local cohort of KSU students. Mentors work closely with these students as they pursue scientific discovery involving advanced materials from liquid crystal chemistry and soft condensed matter physics to bio- and nanomaterials. The students participate in all aspects of the scientific process, from design and execution of their project to interpretation and dissemination of research results, all in a cooperative and collegial atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early participation in a research experience has been identified as an important component of student engagement in science. The provision of a unique first research experience is at the heart of this REU program with a lasting impact on the career of the participating students. Aside from exposure to a multidisciplinary research culture, this experience creates new friendships, networks, and aspirations that will endure long after the summer research experiences are completed. Effective mentoring of the undergraduate students throughout this program and an integrative approach will foster the development of critical research skills and advance career prospects. Mentors benefit from the enhanced science productivity through the participation of these new scientists, and the participating undergraduates enjoy a still larger long-term impact as they evolve into their own distinct pursuits.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project will integrate glacial geology, detailed ice-margin mapping, &lt;br/&gt;and high-resolution geochronology to assess the influence of climate and topography on the extent and retreat &lt;br/&gt;of a marine margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet is southeastern Alaska. This project will provide new &lt;br/&gt;insights into the processes that control the stability of marine ice-sheet margins. It will yield a direct &lt;br/&gt;chronology of a western Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreat along a marine margin, thereby facilitating &lt;br/&gt;reconstructions of this part of the ice sheet and adding to knowledge about the spatial and temporal &lt;br/&gt;relationships among climate, topography, and ice-sheet extent. This project will generate new insights into &lt;br/&gt;the processes that control the stability of marine ice sheet margins and provide empirical constraints to &lt;br/&gt;improve predictive models of the ice sheet-climate system. In addition, the project will provide direct &lt;br/&gt;evidence of ice-free conditions in previously proposed coastal ice-free areas along the Pacific Rim of &lt;br/&gt;North America that will have important implications for analyses of human migrations into the Americas. &lt;br/&gt;Project results will be incorporated into an outreach program conducted in concert with the Buffalo Museum &lt;br/&gt;of Science that synthesizes current research in geography, paleoclimatology, anthropology, and paleontology &lt;br/&gt;to educate the public about the causes and consequences of changing environmental conditions. As a Doctoral &lt;br/&gt;Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student &lt;br/&gt;to establish a strong independent research career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marine ice-sheet margins, including those in present-day Greenland and Antarctica, are thought to be highly &lt;br/&gt;sensitive to climatic variation, but the effects of environmental change on marine ice sheet margins are &lt;br/&gt;still poorly understood. During the Last Glacial Maximum (roughly 26,000 to 19,000 years ago), the &lt;br/&gt;Cordilleran Ice Sheet covered much of western North America, stretching from southern Alaska to the &lt;br/&gt;Pacific Northwest of the U.S. Relatively little is known about Cordilleran Ice Sheet behavior during this &lt;br/&gt;time period, particularly along the west coast where it terminated in the ocean. This project will focus on &lt;br/&gt;three sets of research questions concerning the behavior of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet during and &lt;br/&gt;following the Last Glacial Maximum: (1) How extensive was the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in southeastern Alaska &lt;br/&gt;during the Last Glacial Maximum, and did any areas of southeastern Alaska remain ice-free? This question will &lt;br/&gt;be addressed using cosmogenic exposure dating of the beryllium-10 isotope bedrock and boulder surfaces in &lt;br/&gt;previously proposed ice-free areas. Together with detailed mapping of the paleo-ice margin from publicly &lt;br/&gt;available topographic data and aerial imagery, exposure ages from these locations will allow the doctoral &lt;br/&gt;student to reconstruct the maximum extent of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet. (2) What was the timing and &lt;br/&gt;pace of retreat of the western Cordilleran Ice Sheet? Cosmogenic beryllium-10 dating of rock surfaces along &lt;br/&gt;coast-to-inland transects will be used to resolve this question, which has implications for basic &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the sensitivity of marine-terminating ice sheets to climate change. (3) What environmental &lt;br/&gt;factors, such as ocean warming, atmospheric warming, and sea-level rise, influenced ice-sheet retreat? The &lt;br/&gt;retreat chronology developed in this study will be correlated with existing climate and sea-level records to &lt;br/&gt;test the hypothesis that ocean warming was the primary factor influencing marine ice-sheet collapse in &lt;br/&gt;southeastern Alaska.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>A large earthquake imposes a sudden change of stress in the earth's mantle. Its post-earthquake deformation is observed by GPS at the earth's surface. This project is an experimental and theoretical investigation of the material behavior of the deep earth in response to large earthquakes. The results can be implemented in computer simulations for better understanding of the earthquake cycle and its role in the spatial and temporal distribution of the earthquake hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The material behavior of the earth's mantle when it is subjected to a sudden change of stress by a large earthquake will be examined through laboratory rock deformation experiments. The theoretical model extrapolates from the laboratory to the earth in numerical simulations. This research will enhance understanding of post-seismic relaxation and postglacial rebound. More generally it will enhance understanding of the earthquake cycle, one of the most important problems in geophysics. The research also has potential applications in materials science.</AbstractNarration>

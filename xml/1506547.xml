    <AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and educational activities aimed at achieving a fundamental understanding of how strong electron-electron interactions can bring about novel states of matter, such as topological insulators and topological superconductors. Topological insulators are insulating materials that do not conduct electricity in the bulk but are surrounded by metallic states that cover the surfaces, edges, and interfaces. Similarly, topological superconductors are thought to be like ordinary superconductors in the bulk in that they conduct electricity without loss, but their surfaces and edges are enveloped in a fundamentally new quantum state of electrons with unusual properties. These exotic surface and edge states are not only fundamentally interesting in their own right, but they can also be potentially manipulated for a variety of applications ranging from high-speed quantum computing to ultra-sensitive magnetic devices. This project aims to identify new materials with topological properties in a family of materials where the strong electron-electron interactions give rise to heavy carriers whose masses can be several hundred times the mass of a bare electron. This project aims at formulating the basic principles which will help experimentalists design novel materials and will be performed in close collaboration with several experimental groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active learning approach will be the touchstone of the educational component of the project. The PI will redesign an existing freshman course, "Seven Ideas That Shook the Universe", around peer discussions to improve student understanding, involvement and performance. The PI will also create a continuation of this course, "Seven Ideas That Are Shaping the Future", by focusing on current developments in physics. The interactive activities developed for both courses will be made available online. In order to attract more physics majors and graduate students to condensed matter physics, the PI will prepare engaging research plans for students. The plans will help the students grasp deeper conceptual issues underlying the problem at hand, get first-hand experience in cutting-edge research, and develop their problem-solving skills. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports theoretical research and educational activities aimed at achieving a fundamental understanding of how strong electron-electron interactions can bring about novel states of matter, such as topological insulators and topological superfluids. The main objectives are to study novel electronic phases in newly discovered topological Kondo insulators, to discover candidates for topological superconductors, and to promote their eventual technological application by examining non-equilibrium dynamics of topological superfluids. The main part of this project will focus on materials which contain elements with f-electronic orbitals. The coupling between magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom, which operates in the background of strong spin-orbit interaction and strong electronic correlations, plays a defining role in these materials and provides a unique insight into the properties of f-electron topological insulators and superconductors.

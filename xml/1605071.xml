    <AbstractNarration>1605114 / 1605071 &lt;br/&gt;PIs: Bond, Jesse Q. / Crossley, Steven P. &lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: SusChEM: Phase-specific catalysis combined with reactive distillation for the selective production of butadiene from y-valerolactone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economically feasible conversion of biomass to chemicals is of critical importance for sustainability. Inherent inefficiencies in alkane activation and production gaps caused by the recent shale gas boom have created niches within the petrochemical industry that might realistically be filled by biomass. The goal of this collaborative project is to develop a new technology for selective production of a relatively high-value petrochemical, butadiene, from aqueous solutions of gamma-valerolactone, a biomass derived chemical. The butadiene markets have become increasingly volatile after the recent paradigm shift in refinery operation. The researchers will develop a multiphase reactor to achieve selective butadiene production from aqueous solutions of gamma-valerolactone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The envisioned chemical transformation occurs through sequential ring opening of valerolactone to form pentenoic acid isomers, which subsequently undergo decarbonylation to form butadiene. A multiphase reactor will be employed to achieve ring opening of valerolactone to form pentenoic acids in an aqueous phase, extraction of these pentenoic acids into an organic phase, decarbonylation of pentenoic acids in the organic phase to form butadiene, and reactive distillation of butadiene from the organic phase to a sweep gas. Fundamental studies of the governing phenomena will be undertaken in order to develop strategies for maximizing butadiene selectivity. The aim will be to integrate non-ideal solution thermodynamics, phase and chemical equilibria, reaction kinetics, and transport phenomena into an overall process model and functional reactor design. This approach will also lead to a better fundamental understanding of condensed phase catalysis and multiphase reactors. In addition to training graduate students, the PIs plan to engage high school and undergraduate students in their research and develop an educational module on biomass refining.</AbstractNarration>

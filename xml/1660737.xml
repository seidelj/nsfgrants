    <AbstractNarration>This award is to assist approximately 35 US-based graduate students to attend the 12th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI 2016) in Savannah, GA, on Nov 2-4, 2016. The conference focuses on computer systems, and brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in the premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. The OSDI Symposium emphasizes innovative research as well as quantified or insightful experiences in systems design and implementation. The papers represent some of the most outstanding work in the areas of file and storage systems, embedded systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile systems, secure and reliable systems, virtualization and troubleshooting of complex systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this trip is to provide students with unique opportunities to interact with senior researchers in the field, and exposes students to leading edge work. The support requested in this proposal will enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend OSDI.</AbstractNarration>

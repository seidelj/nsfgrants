    <AbstractNarration>This project will allow for partial support for students participating in the 22nd International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics, CHEP 2016, that will be held in San Francisco, October 10-14, 2016. CHEP is a global conference with participation by leaders in physics, computing, and large-scale data analysis from the top universities and laboratories around the world. The CHEP speakers will address challenges in computing, networking and software for the world's leading data-intensive science experiments. The participation of students in this conference is important for training purposes and future workforce development activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHEP 2016 is organized jointly by Stanford University, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Approximately 600 computing experts and scientists are expected to attend CHEP 2016 with strong participation from the science programs at CERN, Fermilab and other major experimental facilities. CHEP 2016 will exploit this environment to stress the increasing importance of the computing-related connections between high-energy and nuclear physics and data-intensive astronomy, X-ray science and computational science. The program spans a wide range of subjects including trigger, data acquisition and control systems, reconstruction and data analysis algorithms, data processing workflows and computing models, artificial intelligence, network systems and security, and many additional topics.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Clark Atlanta University (CAU) proposes to the National Science Foundation's MRI program to acquire a modern secondary ion mass spectrometer for multidisciplinary research and training of next generation scientists, i. e., undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students in physics, materials science, and chemistry. The new instrument will replace a single investigator, custom built system that is over 30 years old. The tool will significantly enhance the research infrastructure of CAU and it will provide a high level of research and training opportunities for local materials research community. This will augment a suite of existing characterization tools that are oriented to impact research lines in various areas of materials research. This multi-user tool will be configured to serve the multidisciplinary needs of a diverse faculty representing 6 STEM departments, 3 Historically Black College or Universities, and 2 Minority Serving Institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This acquisition will provide depth profile, chemical species identification, stoichiometry, and expanded imaging analysis capability. This will augment a suite of existing characterization tools that are oriented to impact research lines in solid state lighting, polymer synthesis and functionalization, semiconductors, two-dimensional topological materials and device processing. The shared access of this tool will broadly impact and foster interdisciplinary collaborations across departments and institutions and provide a major training resource for the next generation of materials scientists. This community effort has already had a significant impact on the number of under-represented minorities and women in the STEM disciplines. The tool will enhance students with readily marketable skills in materials analysis and characterization to compete globally. This acquisition in conjunction with the existing instrumentation will establish a suite of state-of-the art materials characterization tools that are unique to the geographical area.</AbstractNarration>

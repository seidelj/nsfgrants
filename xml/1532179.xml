    <AbstractNarration>The PIs will create a self-sustaining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) facility with unique capabilities for advanced materials research at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). This instrumentation request includes an atomic force microscope (AFM) coupled to an optical microscope for simultaneous imaging and physical properties measurements at the nanoscale for a wide range of advanced materials in renewable energy and life sciences. The proposed facility is designed for a multi-user environment and will be operated in a shared-use facility, with participation from the majority of departments across campus as well as our regional partners the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Children's Hospital Colorado (CHC). The PIs will organize and host an annual Rocky Mountain Scanning Probe Microscopy Workshop to provide training opportunities and attract new regional users to the facility beyond our partners at NREL and CHC. Undergraduates will be introduced to SPM through our existing summer REU programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will create a self-sustaining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) facility with unique capabilities for advanced materials research at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM). This instrumentation request includes an atomic force microscope (AFM) coupled to an optical microscope for simultaneous imaging and physical properties measurements at the nanoscale for a wide range of advanced materials. The unique feature of the proposed SPM facility is its ability to measure electrical and mechanical properties of materials in direct registry with topography at nanoscale resolution under their designed operating conditions (e.g illumination of photovoltaics and hydrated conditions for biological). The measurement of interfacial physical properties at small length scales is essential to the development of the next generation of materials for renewable energy and life sciences. This facility will transform the current empirical understanding of these complex materials into true science. Specific advanced capabilities beyond standard SPM modes (contact, tapping, phase) include optical microscopy, electro/mechanical property measurement, and environmental control. The microscope facilitates quick identification of the specific region of interest and enables optical stimulation to obtain properties such as a photoconductivity or fluorescence in registry with topology. Spatially resolved measurements of critical material properties such as conductivity, modulus, and viscoelasticity can be made as a function of temperature, humidity, and illumination intensity/wavelength.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>Recent astronomical observations demonstrate that a large number of planets are found beyond our solar system. Many of these planets, which are found orbiting stars other than the Sun, are located in "Habitable Zones". A Habitable Zone is the temperate region surrounding a star in which water could exist as a liquid. While the technology needed to measure the radius of planets is now available, instruments capable of measuring the mass of Earth-like worlds located in the Habitable Zones have yet to be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will build a new astronomical tool, called a spectrograph, for the Large Binocular Telescope, in Arizona. Unlike previous instruments, which are limited by blurry images caused by the distorting effects of Earth's turbulent atmosphere, this project will use hardware that corrects for atmospheric turbulence, creating clear (diffraction-limited) images that enable measurements at much higher resolution. By measuring wobbles in a star's motion, with exquisite precision, the investigators will determine the mass and density of planets that transit across the face of their parent star. They will learn the atmospheric composition of these planets. The investigators will study the physical properties of nearby worlds that hold the potential for life. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The investigators will train students in building astronomical instrumentation. Further, research and public engagement will be integrated through a new outreach program called "Living Worlds". A STEM-based initiative that promotes science for grade school children through hands-on activities, a series of national contests designed for K-8 students will be developed to foster and maintain an interest in science through the search for extrasolar planets and life elsewhere in the universe.</AbstractNarration>

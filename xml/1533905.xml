    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate a computer aided design (CAD) framework that can be used for verification and reliability analysis of hybrid bio-silicon circuits used for designing biosensors. It is envisioned that similar to integrated circuit (IC) CAD design tools, the same framework will be useful in biosensor system optimization and in the discovery of new sensing modalities that combine proteins and silicon circuits at a system level. Similar to an IC design-flow, the proposed simulation and analysis framework will be used to verify the functionality and reliability of biosensor systems before undertaking laborious fabrication and experimental procedures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With advances in micro-nano-fabrication, the emerging biosensors can integrate an ever increasing number of detection elements on the same device. This has opened the possibility that perhaps exploiting spatial redundancies across multiple detection experiments could be used to alleviate the effects of biosensor artifacts using forward error-correcting techniques. However, the full potential of this technique in biosensing methods can only be achieved on high-density arrays that can potentially integrate millions of protein-based circuits. The proposed research would serve as a simulation and analysis framework to verify the functionality and reliability of these high-density assays before undertaking painstaking fabrication and experimental procedures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an outreach component of this proposal, the PI plans to make software tools and the library of protein-based circuit models publicly available through a webportal. The users will be able to modify the software and integrate the modules with other circuit simulation tools. From the perspective of a computer scientist or a VLSI researcher the software could serve as a useful tool for explorations in the area of hybrid bio-silicon circuits without resorting to time-consuming laboratory experiments. The PI is also strongly committed to the training of women, underrepresented and K-12 students. Different outreach programs which are available at Michigan State University be used to recruit students to participate in the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

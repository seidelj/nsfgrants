    <AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks to understand and further develop a relatively new class of metal carbide catalysts for the selective catalytic conversion of woody biomass material to useful chemicals. Refining of biomass material is presently a complicated and energy intensive process. The proposed work aims to make the conversion process more efficient by improving catalyst design and targeting the selective conversion of intermediate products to high-value chemicals. The work will help make bio-refining processes more competitive with existing petroleum refining processes, and thereby aid progress toward a sustainable chemical and energy future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will examine the conversion of a set of lignin-derived monomers to aromatic compounds utilizing metal carbide catalysts. It is inspired by preliminary results from the same group showing greater than 80% carbon conversion of anisole to benzene with stable time-on-stream performance for approximately 60 hours. The proposed work will obtain more detailed understanding of the rate constants, site requirements, and relationships between catalyst structure and composition, all of which can be used to develop improved metal carbide catalysts. To this end, the researchers will develop synthesis and characterization protocols for metal carbide catalysts, and then identify active sites and opportunities for selective carbon-oxygen bond cleavage to produce high-value aromatic products. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although this proposal is directed specifically at metal carbide catalysts for upgrading intermediates of lignin pyrolysis, it potentially will advance the field by providing a framework for thinking about catalysis on materials exhibiting a range of surface functionalities, and reactions involving equally complex molecules. The catalyst synthesis work, combined with structural and chemical characterization data, and rigorous kinetic data, will be integrated to obtain better understanding of the challenges and opportunities for optimizing catalysts to attack specific bonds and selectively produce specific products. The PI has developed corresponding educational and outreach programs that increase awareness of sustainable chemistry and renewable energy across a broad community ranging from university alumni to elementary through high school students.</AbstractNarration>

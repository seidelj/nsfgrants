    <AbstractNarration>Invasive species are major drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide and cost billions of dollars each year to control. Understanding why particular species become invasive is critically important to developing effective methods for their management. In this regard, the interactions between invasive plants and their associated fungi may be particularly important. These interactions are noteworthy because fungi can have both positive and negative effects on plants; some may benefit plants by increasing their competitive ability and others may damage plants by causing disease. This study will determine the diversity and impacts of fungi on a wetland grass, common reed (Phragmites australis), that has both native and invasive forms in North America. Experiments will be conducted to determine whether fungi differently influence how native and invasive forms of common reed respond to changing nutrient conditions. In addition to providing a better understanding of how fungi may help spread some invasive species, results from this study may reveal how fungi can be used in novel ways to control the spread of invasive species. Furthermore, this project will provide important research training for graduate and undergraduate students. Research findings will be shared through scientific meetings, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and a poster on invasive species that is designed for children and displayed at a popular nature park in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although native genotypes of P. australis are widely distributed in North America, a European genotype has spread rapidly over the past 150 years. Using field surveys and a greenhouse experiment, the following predictions regarding the invasibility of P. australis will be tested: invasive P. australis genotypes will 1) have lower foliar and soil fungi diversity, 2) have less damage from foliar and soil pathogens, and 3) be superior in competitive and nutrient uptake ability in comparison to native genotypes. In addition, tests will be performed to determine if nutrient availability, soil fungi, and plant competition interact in complex ways to promote invasion success of P. australis genotypes from Europe. Field surveys of foliar and soil fungi will be conducted throughout North America, ensuring adequate replication of native and invasive P. australis genotypes and maximizing the diversity of fungi encountered. Foliar fungi will be cultured in the laboratory from diseased leaf tissue, and DNA sequencing will be used to identify fungi from cultures and soil samples. A plant-soil feedback greenhouse experiment will also be conducted to examine the interactive effects of soil biota, nutrients, and competition on the fitness of native and invasive genotypes of P. australis.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The American Meteorological Society (AMS) conducts a Summer Policy Colloquium in Washington DC to develop leadership skills of attendees by providing introduction to methods for reconciling scientific opportunities with national priorities. Annually, the Colloquium participants consist of 30 graduate students, early career scientists, and faculty. National Science Foundation Scholarships are provided for 10 students, early-career scientists, and faculty from Minority Serving Institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Colloquium participants are addressed by agency leaders, policy makers, journalists, and government leaders in the legislative and executive branches. The unique set of instructors in the Colloquium typically has interdisciplinary backgrounds in science, policy, and law. The attendees are provided instruction to allow development of skills and techniques for communicating science to policymakers and the public in ways that encourage information sharing and collaboration. Additionally, through instruction, examples, and exercises, attendees learn the legislative process and the roles of science information in support of policy. As a result, the national dialogue among scientists, policymakers, and the public will become more efficient, clear, and solution-oriented. This benefits support of national policy with respect to increased understanding and management of natural resources critical to food, water, energy, resilience to hazards, and environmental protection.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The University of Michigan Physics REU program provides a transformative summer research experience for undergraduate students from around the country who otherwise may not have access to a major research program. The first goal of the program is to prepare the students for a career in the physical sciences. The second goal is for the students to perform cutting edge research in modern physics laboratories with active research groups and dedicated faculty. The research areas include astrophysics and cosmology, atomic, molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics, nonlinear dynamics, complex systems and nuclear physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU students work closely with a faculty mentor on a carefully crafted ten-week research project. The selected students are interviewed to determine their interest and are then matched to faculty who are active in research in that area. The project is defined based on the interest of the student and the research needs of the faculty. In addition to the research project the students are exposed to a variety of research topics and methodologies through a series of faculty research seminars. Professional development is a critical part of the REU program and students participate in tutorials on ethics, applying to graduate school, applying for grants, scientific writing and giving scientific presentations. Students engage in additional educational and social activities, including safety training, machine shop and electronic shop classes, lab tours and a variety of lunches with other students and faculty. These activities allow students to put their research experience in a wider perspective, to build a network of professional contacts, and to develop professional skills in a scientific environment.</AbstractNarration>

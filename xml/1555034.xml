    <AbstractNarration>This project is focused on establishing a fundamental understanding of the formation, processing, and fate of nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere. A series of laboratory chamber experiments will be performed to study the reactions of nitrogen compounds with volatile gases from biogenic sources. The results will lead to a better understanding of the formation of very small particles in the atmosphere that are relevant to air quality and climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed research are to (1) To experimentally map out the effects of different environmental factors (humidity, temperature, particle acidity) on the formation of organic nitrate (ON) from biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) and NO3; (2) To determine the changes in gas-particle partitioning and properties of ON with dark aging and photochemical aging; and (3) To characterize ON and the formation of secondary organic aerosol from BVOC+NO3 and assess their fates in a region of high BVOC/anthropogenic emissions.</AbstractNarration>

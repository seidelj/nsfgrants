<AbstractNarration>A request is made by the University of Washington to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Thompson, a 274? general purpose, global class research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These platforms provide facilities for conducting oceanographic research funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies. The instrumentation they propose to acquire will provide operational flexibility to projects that are embarked upon both vessels and will increase their capacity to do useful science and data collection during transits between funded cruises. Thompson completed 275 days in 2015; 133 of these days (48%) were for NSF. On Barnes, 9 of the 50 days (18%) were for NSF. In 2016, Thompson is scheduled for 130 days and 49 (38%) are for NSF. The schedule is light for Thompson because she goes into the yard for a mid-life refit in June. Barnes is scheduled to sail 86 days in 2016, with 9 days (9%) funded by NSF. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Turner  Fluorometer $9,278 &lt;br/&gt;2) Upgrade of computer racks $29,953 &lt;br/&gt;3) Fume Hoods $62,582 &lt;br/&gt;4) Computer network upgrade $67,993 &lt;br/&gt;5) Virtual machine server upgrades $37,954 &lt;br/&gt;6) C-Nav 3050 Receiver $10,914 &lt;br/&gt;7) -80 C Chest Freezer $7,776 &lt;br/&gt;8) WiFi distribution system upgrades $8,854 &lt;br/&gt;       $235,304 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

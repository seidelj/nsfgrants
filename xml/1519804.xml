    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project lies in the ability to simplify treatment of infertility due to PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). PCOS affects 1 in 6 women of childbearing age, and it impacts the ability to ovulate naturally. The most common 2nd-line treatment is injectable hormones that cost $15,000-$20,000 for a 6-month course and require 5-6 clinical visits each month to avoid serious side-effects. Clinical guidelines also recommend an infrequently used laparoscopic surgery that normalizes ovulation and leads to a similar pregnancy rate to hormone injections. This funding will foster work enabling the same tissue effects as the surgery but via a minimally-invasive needle-based route of access, similar to what is commonly used in other fertility procedures. This will be significantly advantageous to patients and physicians for the following reasons: costs half as much as hormone injections, enables natural ovulation via a 1-time procedure, requires few clinical visits, and reduces rates of twins/triplets to 1-2% (as compared to 20-25% for hormones) so pregnancies will be less complicated. In the US, 75% of fertility expenses are paid out-of-pocket by patients, so drastically reducing costs will allow greater access to these treatments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project specifically seeks to fund work to characterize the feasibility of replicating the surgical effects using a minimally-invasive, needle-based approach performed under ultrasound guidance. Metrics for success for this work will be sufficient and predictable volumes of tissue affected using devices with parameters consistent with a commercially acceptable device (needle-based access, ultrasound visualization, acceptable energy delivery times and powers, and techniques falling within the skill-set of fertility physicians).</AbstractNarration>

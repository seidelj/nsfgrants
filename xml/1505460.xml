    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the continued development, assessment, and dissemination of Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorials (QuILT) and peer-instruction tools for undergraduate courses to prepare future scientists and engineers for the demands of the high-tech workplace. A solid grasp of the fundamental principles of quantum physics is essential for most scientists and engineers, considering that the global economy has become increasingly dependent on science and technology based upon quantum phenomena. Single electron transistors, SQUIDs, quantum-well lasers, and other innovative quantum devices are made possible by an understanding of the underlying quantum processes. However, quantum physics is a technically difficult and abstract subject. The subject matter makes instruction quite challenging; able students constantly struggle to master basic concepts. To sustain U.S. leadership in science and technology, it is critical to ensure that advanced undergraduate students (and graduate students) preparing for careers in science and engineering develop a solid grasp of the fundamental concepts of quantum physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;QuILTs and peer-instruction tools are based upon a cognitive-apprenticeship model of learning and emphasize modeling, coaching and weaning. To aid instructors, the concept-based and problem-based QuILTs and peer-instruction tools will be keyed with most of the common textbooks. However, every effort will be made to ensure that the different modules fit together as a coherent whole and help students organize their knowledge in a hierarchical fashion. Some tools expose students to contemporary and exciting topics such as quantum cryptography that can be taught using simple two-level systems.</AbstractNarration>

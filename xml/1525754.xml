    <AbstractNarration>This project extends the PI's prior research into achieving high performance for multiprecision arithmetic utilizing commodity graphics processors (GPUs). Multiprecision (MP) arithmetic has important applications in science, engineering, and mathematics when computations require greater numerical precision than standard computer systems support. It is also an important part of cryptography used in secure internet communication. GPUs can accelerate MP arithmetic by more than two orders of magnitude. However, achieving this performance requires novel algorithms and software tools. The world-record performance for exponentiation achieved under the prior grant will be extended to include floating point vector arithmetic. A new code generation model will enable handling a wider range of precisions across newer generations of graphics processors. Support for clusters of GPUs to work together on larger problems, and practical demonstrations of the effectiveness of MP library such as showing how one GPU can offload decryption work from more than a hundred servers, with higher levels of security than are currently in common use, is being developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each generation of GPU architecture requires extensive experimentation and reworking of multiprecision code to obtain a new optimum. Yet the potential benefits of a portable and scalable package could be transformational in certain application areas. This effort extends PI's prior work to include floating point and vectors, and begin the transition to GPU clusters. The result will be a publicly available multi-precision arithmetic package and implementation toolset that enables the scientific community to easily take full advantage of GPU scaling to obtain at least an order of magnitude improvement in performance per dollar and performance per watt over CPUs at the same technology step. The approach relies on a novel set of models for GPU storage that provide a higher level of abstraction over which the code generation tools can search for optimal combinations of algorithm, register/memory layout, and kernel launch geometry for a given precision size and GPU architectural generation to achieve maximum resource utilization.</AbstractNarration>

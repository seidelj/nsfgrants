    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the fifth "Gone Fishing" meeting on Poisson Geometry to be held at the University of Colorado at Boulder from March 31 to April 3, 2016. The "Gone Fishing" workshop series consists of regular meetings in North America of mathematicians interested in Poisson Geometry and its applications, attracting leading experts and young researchers alike. The aim of the series is to promote interaction between mathematicians, physicists, and groups working on related areas having different perspectives. As these various fields continue to progress further, it is becoming increasingly urgent to encourage more interaction and cross fertilization between them. Last but not least the "Gone Fishing" meetings provide a unique forum forjunior mathematicians from all over the United States to learn about cutting edge developments in Poisson Geometry and to disseminate their own research results in the field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poisson Geometry originates as the mathematical formulation of classical mechanics as the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics. Its history begins with 19th century classics by Poisson, Hamilton, Jacobi, and Lie, developing into a separate field in its own right around 1980 via the works of Lichnerowicz and Weinstein. Today, Poisson Geometry intersects and is applied to many areas of mathematics, including symplectic geometry, generalized complex geometry, Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids, geometric mechanics, cluster algebras, integrable systems, quantization, non-commutative geometry, stratification theory, and the geometry of singular symplectic and Poisson structures. The "Gone Fishing" workshops provide an excellent opportunity for scientists based in North America to exchange ideas and stimulate collaboration. Each workshop has a goal to address important questions and future directions of the subject. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://math.colorado.edu/gonefishing2016/</AbstractNarration>

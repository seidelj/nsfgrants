    <AbstractNarration>This project supports the travel of 20 graduate students from U.S. institutions to the ACM SIGCOMM 2015 Conference that will be held Aug. 17-21, 2015, in London, United Kingdom. ACM SIGCOMM is the flagship annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Data Communications (SIGCOMM), a special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). This project project integrates research and education of students through exposure to a premier technical meeting in computer networks and communications. Students will have the opportunity to observe high-quality presentations and interact with senior researchers in the field both in the main conference and the associated workshops. The PIs especially encourage women and other minorities to participate. SIGCOMM is the flagship international conference for computer networking research, and presents a unique opportunity for students to expand their breadth of ideas, research skills, and technical perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide each student with a travel award of $1,250 or the actual documented amount of expenses, whichever amounts to less. The availability of the travel awards will be well publicized throughout the U.S. research community. The project has established processes for selecting the awardees that are well described and that are appropriate for such a student travel grant.</AbstractNarration>

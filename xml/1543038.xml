    <AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating an innovative building envelope system to fill the industry need for enhanced resistance to natural and man-made hazards including explosions and impact events from wind or water-borne hazards. It also provides energy efficiency and ease of construction. This building envelope system, the comb-tie envelope system, is important because it will enhance the understanding of how insulated wall panel systems can be used to provide a thermally efficient and blast resistive envelope to building systems. Competitive technology is not currently available and thus the system will create new markets by providing a cost effective solution for federal and military building construction where blast protection and energy efficiency are required. The technology will also complement existing technology used for conventional construction applications. The technology can be manufactured in the U.S. providing the potential for new business and employment opportunities. The project will result in a proof-of-concept of the comb-tie envelope system with the following unique features: ease of installation, the ability to support loads under large panel displacements, and thermal efficiency. These features provide the following advantages: performance under extreme loads, cost savings, and thermal efficiency when compared to the leading competing composite panel systems in this market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The system relies on an innovative shear tie connector and a supporting design approach. The knowledge gaps addressed will include determination of the idealized connector shape for installation and pullout and shear performance, the strength provided by the connector, verification of the capacity under loading, and validation of the design approach. The project will finalize the detailing of the tie system developed for the insulated panels through finite element modeling of the system. The ability of the tie to provide composite action to the wall system and the ability to be easily installed will be quantified. The refined details will be prototyped and experimentally evaluated through pullout tests and shear tests to quantify the strength provided. These component property results will be used for finalizing the design approach which allow for fabrication and load testing to ensure that the design strength and deformation performance levels are achieved. The complete system will also be verified under explosive loading to verify the dynamic capabilities of the systems. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduates and graduate students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through the proof-of-concept development, and market opportunity investigations with industry trade organizations and wall panel producers.</AbstractNarration>

<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve data security by preventing eavesdropping on a communication channel. This project takes into consideration the location of potential eavesdroppers and fading channel signals to prevent unauthorized access to communication. The project will enhance information security by providing a technology that uses less computation power, while insuring longer battery life, to secure communication.  The project provides an alternative choice for securing communication by not relying on traditional encryption, which sometimes has been vulnerable to attacks. The potential application of this I-Corps project includes, but is not limited to: financial sector, military, government research institutions, healthcare, and other security-sensitive applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project utilizes a combination of signaling and coding techniques to provide security against eavesdroppers by not relying on a secret pair of keys that traditional cryptography schemes are known for. This technology uses a combination of channel codes and physical location of eavesdroppers to prevent the eavesdroppers from gaining access to the communication wave.  The research for this project enhanced security by using a lower probability of message detection and error correction technique at the physical layer of the internet model. The technology adds bits to messages and ensures that the messages cannot be decoded by eavesdroppers.  More specifically, the technology exploits degrading signals, noise, interference, and localization techniques to provide secure communication. The proposed technology uses less computation power than traditional approaches and is thus a great fit for biological sensors. This scheme achieves information confidentiality, integrity and authentication.</AbstractNarration>

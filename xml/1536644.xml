    <AbstractNarration>Since 1978, the Oceanic Flux Program (OFP) has continuously measured particle movement, known as particle flux, from surface waters to the deep Sargasso Sea, revealing important information about changing ocean chemistry. It is the longest-running particle flux time series and is unique in its focus on the deep ocean. This award will continue funding this fundamental oceanographic time-series, lengthening the record of data and allowing for a better understanding of how the observed flux patterns relate to the interplay between climate and ocean functioning. Continued support of the time series will provide training and educational opportunities for young scientists from high school students through postdoctoral researchers, and results will tie into other time-series efforts in the Bermuda region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding of ocean variability over interannual and decadal time-scales is of widespread interest and increasing relevance given the concerns over anthropogenic perturbations of global climate and ocean chemistry due to increases in greenhouse gases. Ocean ecosystems are now well-recognized to be affected by global and regional climate patterns such as ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation, and an imperative exists to model the ocean?s response to future climate scenarios. This requires a fundamental understanding of how the ocean and its biota naturally respond to climate and environmental forcing variables, and how these responses, in turn, affect ocean biogeochemical cycles. The OFP time-series has produced a unique unsurpassed record of temporal variability in the "biological pump", a term loosely applied to material transfer from the surface to the deep ocean. The record has documented interannual and longer variations in deep fluxes and shorter term fluctuations driven by the interactions between mesoscale physical variability, meteorological forcing and ecosystem responses. The OFP sample archives are an unparalleled resource for study of the biogeochemical consequences of changing ocean chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

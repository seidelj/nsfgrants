    <AbstractNarration>Despite the recent advances in automated processing of natural language, approaching general human-level understanding of text in many cases still remains challenging. This CAREER project addresses one such challenge, automatically extracting and understanding the order and timing of events described in natural language text narratives. It develops a computational framework for representing and extracting temporal information conveyed in text, with the end goal to enable realistic temporal reasoning from text. It also engages student involvement in computer science research early on, and in particular is designed to attract female students to pursue careers in computer science and related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As distinct from existing approaches, the proposed research assumes underspecification to be an integral property of temporal representation, supported by the notion of a coarse-grained event cluster. It takes advantage of the micro-structure of narrative text by identifying event clusters and their narrative anchors which, together with default event times and durations, serve to organize the underspecified representation of the timeline. It also addresses knowledge gaps in the current state-of-the-art in by developing three key components. First, a novel representational scheme is employed to facilitate simple, intuitive choices for the annotators that minimize cognitive effort and reduce annotation error. Question answering serves as the target application, with a focus on reading-comprehension questions that require temporal reasoning beyond understanding simple factoids. Second, novel methods for intrinsic evaluation of annotation consistency are used to address problems with existing evaluation methods, which often produce varied results depending on specific strategies for crediting temporal relations inferred through transitive closure over the temporal relation graph. The proposed methods rely on representing temporal relations as partially ordered sets and use linear extensions of these partial orders in order to evaluate inter-annotator agreement and system performance. Finally, a new class of neural network-based models is explored that aim to recover partial order graphs over anchored event clusters. These models use external memory components for cumulative discourse representation, and allow joint training for identifying coreferent event mentions, grouping the recovered events into roughly-simultaneous event clusters, and establishing typed links between them. The models incorporate a representation for default event order and timing, as well as argument structure for events and quantitative inference over temporal expressions.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support for the design, implementation, and assessment of strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Tougaloo College seeks to establish the foundation for "Preparing Undergraduates in STEM Holistically (PUSH)". The goal of the project is to establish a multi-layered approach that engages faculty and students with the ultimate goal of developing a model for utilizing a strong academic environment to strengthen STEM education at the institution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of the project are to: increase student enrollment in STEM undergraduate majors, with a special emphasis in the Physical Sciences; improve retention in core courses with evidence-based teaching strategies and course redesign; and develop a dual-degree engineering curriculum with partner schools Mississippi State University and Brown University, leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

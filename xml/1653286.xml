    <AbstractNarration>Established as part of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), the EMNLP 2016 Student Scholarship Program offers scholarships that subsidize travel, conference and housing expenses to selected students attending the conference, with preference given to financially needy students who may otherwise not be able to attend. By bringing together a pool of student researchers with the scientific and engineering knowledge of NLP from all over the world, these scholarships allow the awardees to make contact with other researchers in the field, discuss research ideas, receive critical feedback on their work, and possibly establish collaborations with them. This provides the students involved with invaluable opportunities for professional growth. In the long run, the Student Scholarship Program can contribute to the maintenance and development of a diverse computational natural language workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organized by SIGDAT, the Association for Computational Linguistics' special interest group for linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to NLP, EMNLP is an annual conference at the intersection of NLP and machine learning. Since its inception two decades ago, EMNLP has gradually established its reputation as one of the premier conferences in NLP that attracts some of the best computational researchers in the field. It would therefore be beneficial for SIGDAT to establish a long-term relationship with the NSF through this pioneering NSF-sponsored Student Scholarship Program, which, if successful, can become an integral part of future EMNLP conferences.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Alcorn State University seeks to improve STEM learning by training faculty in active learning methods and developing a cohort of student peer leaders to support the use of the methods. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the goals of developing faculty expertise in active learning instructional practices and developing a STEM Learning Resource Center for implementing peer led teaching and learning into the STEM curriculum. These will be done by recruiting and training two cohorts of STEM faculty in best practices through workshops, conferences, and an ongoing faculty learning community. The Learning Resource Center will be led by STEM undergraduate students and supervised by STEM faculty. Along with being a repository for STEM career information, the space will be used for course workshops, project and homework assistance, exam preparation and assistance with using resources such as software and library databases. The evaluation and dissemination of this project should be useful in developing models of student and faculty support for STEM majors at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Maintaining U.S. global competitiveness in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) industries requires increasing participation among traditionally underrepresented groups including people of color and women. Studies show creating more equal educational opportunities in the K-12 education system is an effective, socially just approach to expanding STEM participation. This study examines the impact of Texas Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (T-STEM) academies on (a) STEM teacher labor markets and (b) students' educational and workforce outcomes. T-STEM academies are public high schools focused on improving instruction and academic performance in science and mathematics-related subjects and expanding the number of students entering STEM careers, particularly students who are underrepresented in STEM fields. Analyses draw on a statewide longitudinal student-level dataset covering all students in Texas over a 20-year period. This project is supported by the Education and Human Resources Core Research Program, which funds fundamental research in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project objectives are three-fold. First, the study documents whether students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields have equitable access to high-quality STEM teachers across classrooms, schools, and districts. Although prior studies identify a teacher quality gap where disadvantaged students are assigned to less qualified and less effective teachers, no prior studies explore exposure to highly-qualified STEM teachers for advantaged and disadvantaged youth. Second, the study analyzes whether T-STEM academies reduce the STEM teacher quality gap. The third aim of the study is to assess the impact of T-STEM academies on student achievement in math, science, and reading, the likelihood of high school graduation, postsecondary enrollment and completion, as well as students' labor market earnings and the likelihood of employment in a STEM field.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Chen at Spelman College is working with undergraduate students to develop and investigate a new laser spectroscopic technique that was invented at Spelman. This new three-dimensional spectroscopy method can overcome problems and limitations of other existing forms of spectroscopy in the study of the properties and behavior of molecules in chemistry. Specifically in this project, Professor Chen works closely with his students to 1) further develop theory and software for spectral interpretation; 2) demonstrate the study of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as the sample molecule using this technique; 3) combine the new spectroscopic technique with a high resolution, coherent, two dimensional spectroscopic method to improve the speed of data collection and information extraction; and 4) identify other interesting molecules that could benefit from the enhanced capability of this technique. At Spelman College, one of only two Historically Black Colleges for women in the US, many students in Professor Chen's lab are from underrepresented minority groups. With this project, he provides them with a stimulating undergraduate research experience that encourages and better prepares them to pursue graduate school. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High resolution molecular spectroscopy is a mature technique with a long record of providing detailed information about molecular structure and behavior. However, many molecules have stubbornly resisted analysis because the spectra they produce are too heavily congested, perturbed, complex, and patternless. Furthermore, analytical applications of high resolution molecular spectroscopy are limited by difficulty in interpreting spectra when the sample is a mixture. The purpose of the project is to develop and explore the capabilities of High Resolution Coherent Three Dimensional (HRC3D) spectroscopy as a method for overcoming these limitations. In conjunction with a recently developed High Resolution Coherent Two Dimensional (HRC2D) technique, which has complimentary capabilities, these two tools provide an alternative method for studying polyatomic molecules (such as NO2) in systems that cannot be studied using existing methods.</AbstractNarration>

    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The nontechnical description &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of progress in science and engineering over the past 5-10 years, solar panels have become an economically viable means for generating electricity for homes, industries, and transportation. In fact, the cost of providing clean power from solar cells has been cut in half in only 6 years, and consequently, the number of jobs in the industry has skyrocketed. This project focuses on developing next generation solar cell technologies through new designs and manufacturing techniques that will reduce costs further while increasing overall performance. Since solar panel technology has yet to reach maturity, tremendous benefits for society are possible if recently identified engineering and science hurdles can be overcome. A key goal is to implement new materials, manufacturing processes, and characterization tools to enhance the fraction of incident sunlight that is converted to electrical power. Current commercial solar panel designs use a single absorbing semiconductor layer in the device that allows a theoretical maximum of only ~30% conversion of the power in sunlight to electricity. To date, approximately two-thirds of this maximum has been reached. Next generation concepts involve the use of two absorbing semiconducting layers in the so-called "tandem" device structure which will allow a theoretical maximum of ~45% conversion of the incident sunlight to electrical power. Although high efficiency tandems have been fabricated from high cost materials for use in space power, the cost of these cells is too high for large-scale terrestrial use. This project will use a novel strategy that enables dissimilar semiconductor materials to work together and promotes low-cost production technologies of the resulting high efficiency tandem solar cells. Importantly, the approach we will use ensures that the developed devices will be amenable to high-volume manufacturing. The project integrates educational opportunities for students as well as outreach efforts to stakeholders, both designed to increase diversity in our science and engineering workforce and to broaden the impact of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project a new general approach will be developed for fabricating monolithic tandems from dissimilar materials, based on the capabilities of novel solution processable single-wall carbon nanotube tunnel junctions. This approach will create avenues for unlocking the mass production potential of high efficiency, low cost monolithically integrated tandem solar cells for terrestrial use. The general research plan is expected to lead to tandems with a PCE &gt; 30%. The research program leverages existing high efficiency CuIn1-xGaxSe2 (CIGS) devices produced by vacuum co-evaporation and capabilities for producing high efficiency CIGS and perovskite devices based on CH3NH3PbI3 by solution processing in a move toward an all-solution processed monolithically integrated tandem that can be fabricated in one continuous, low-cost manufacturing process. As an integral part of the research, analysis will be performed via spectroscopic ellipsometry and laser beam-induced voltage and current response measurements that will guide the synthesis work. These tools will enable in-depth simulations for understanding of tandem cell performance and will expedite adjustment of the band-gap ratios and layer thicknesses to insure optimal collection and current matching between cells.</AbstractNarration>

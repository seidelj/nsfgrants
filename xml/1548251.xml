    <AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to enhance the economic feasibility of site-specific, variable-rate nitrogen fertilizer management and to increase profitability for corn growers in the U.S. Midwest. This R&amp;D project will lead to new commercial opportunities for implementing site-specific nitrogen recommendation services to approximately 36 million hectares annually under corn production. The simplified soil testing system will enable crop advisers to recommend appropriate nitrogen fertilizer application rates in contrast to non-site-specific recommendations that often exceed crop requirements. There will be a growing demand for independent agronomists and crop consultants who utilize this system to expand the market for precision agriculture, creating employment and business opportunities in the agricultural sector and rural communities. Equally important, the resulting reduction in fertilizer application will reduce non-point source nitrate pollution of natural water resources.The proposed technology development will directly contribute a rational basis for resolving existing and potential legal conflicts arising out of non point source nitrate pollution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a Grand Challenge articulated by the National Academy of Engineering, namely to ?Manage the Nitrogen Cycle?, by providing an actionable soil test that has the potential to reduce fertilizer application by 35% ($70/hectare) on average without impacting corn yields in the Midwest, for annual potential savings of $1.9 bn. This project will lead to a site-specific and industry-transforming alternative to the existing system for nitrogen fertilizer management. The proposed system is based on an established and independently validated soil organic nitrogen assay that currently has limited commercial viability due to labor, skill, and resource requirements. The goal of the project is to increase the economic feasibility of site-specific fertilizer management, by developing, evaluating, and validating a redesigned assay system that allows routine use in a commercial setting and thereby provides a quantitative basis for site-specific nitrogen management. Anticipated technical outcomes include a significant increase in throughput capacity for soil organic nitrogen testing, lower test costs, and reduced capital, space, and skilled labor requirements.</AbstractNarration>

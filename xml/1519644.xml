    <AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Christopher Carone, Joshua Erlich, and Marc Sher at the College of William and Mary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Standard Model of particle physics provides a consistent description of all known elementary particles and their interactions. However, there are many features of the theory that remain mysterious and suggest that the Standard Model is incomplete: How must the theory be modified to explain the observed pattern of elementary particle masses? How must the theory be extended to explain the observational evidence for the existence of dark matter? Is the relatively small mass of the recently discovered Higgs boson hinting at a more complicated spectrum of Higgs-sector particles yet to be discovered? The intellectual merit of the work proposed by Professors Carone, Erlich and Sher stems from its focus on addressing these and other fundamental issues, which will help to advance our understanding of the physics of the elementary particles. With the restart of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and with new results from dark matter detectors imminent, one expects exciting new discoveries in the near future, and the PIs' research will be well timed to explore the results from these experiments. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical law. The Broader Impact of this work is that it furthers the education of undergraduate and PhD research students, including those from underrepresented groups, facilitates outreach to the general public, and promotes high-energy particle physics in the southeastern part of the United States.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of their specific research projects, the PIs anticipate progress along several distinct lines. On the issue of fermion masses, the PIs and their students will study model-independent bounds and cosmological consequences of pseudo-familons - particles that may be light enough to be experimentally accessible even though they are originate from new flavor physics associated with a very high energy scale. On the issue of dark matter, the PIs and their students will consider new models in which a dark sector of particles arises dynamically, such as certain supersymmetric "moose" models in which non-perturbative physics associated with a strongly coupled dark sector drives a messenger sector gauge coupling to very small values. On the issue of Higgs-sector physics, the PIs will study novel two-Higgs doublet models, one class that avoids flavor-changing-neutral currents via non-Abelian discrete symmetries and another class extended as in the Lee-Wick Standard Model, providing numerous predictive relations between heavy Higgs masses and couplings. They will explore the implications of these models for the LHC. In addition to these investigations, the PIs and their students will also consider other fundamental issues, for example, attempting to elucidate the appearance of black-hole horizons in gravity duals of finite-temperature theories by matching appropriate calculations in dual gauge-gravity models to perturbative finite-temperature quantum chromodynamics. Carone, Erlich and Sher will also continue activities that provide a substantial broader impact, including the supervision of undergraduate, PhD, and REU research students, participation in local events (for example, QuarkNet), and continued interaction with local and national media on particle-physics issues.</AbstractNarration>

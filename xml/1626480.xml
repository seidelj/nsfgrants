    <AbstractNarration>Acquisition of a FARO X330 laser scanner by West Texas A&amp;M University (WTAMU) through this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award enables cross-disciplinary researchers to rapidly and accurately collect and preserve perishable damage data resulting from the action of severe wind storms where traditional (contact) measurements cannot be accomplished due to safety concerns or due to limitations on access, time, and personnel. Laser scanning rapidly provides a permanent record of damage conditions for subsequent detailed analysis, including wind-induced damage to structures and thunderstorm-induced damage to agricultural crops. Such analysis of damaged structures enables investigators to determine the intensity of tornado winds since direct measurements of tornado wind speeds are difficult and dangerous to obtain. Wind speeds in the Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale (the official U.S. measure of tornado intensity) are currently based on only estimates and are in need of validation or revision so that engineers can design structures that provide improved safety, resilience, and economy. Acquisition of the laser scanner postures faculty and students in the young, undergraduate engineering program for increased roles in high-level (inter) national research efforts, aiding the goal of WTAMU (an Eligible Institution under Title III Hispanic Serving Institution) in broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in education and research. Collaboration with other national and international hazards researchers is facilitated by WTAMUs sharing of damage information through the new NSF-sponsored NHERI DesignSafe-ci.org data repository. Interaction between scientists at USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory with undergraduate and graduate students and faculty in engineering and agricultural sciences will additionally be enhanced with this new opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laser scanner will be used to acquire comprehensive 3D models of tornado-damaged structures. Measurements of structural member sizes and deformations will be used along with finite-element modeling software to determine the resistance of the structure and the associated wind pressure and wind speed required to produce the observed damages. These results will provide necessary validation or revisions for wind speeds in the EF Scale. The laser scanner will allow investigators to similarly estimate the resistance of hurricane-damaged structures thereby assisting investigators in expanding the EF Scale for use in hurricanes by accounting for the increased resistance of structures along the hurricane coast. Agricultural researchers will use the laser scanner to measure plant growth, density, and canopy cover of multiple High Plains crops with such various treatments as row spacing, water regimen, variety, and nutrient application; the nonintrusive remote measurements allow for simplified and more robust experimental designs. Using research plots at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Research Laboratory (CPRL) at Bushland, TX, crop maturation and growth efficiency measured with the scanner can be correlated with mass gain as indicated by the large weighing lysimeters at CPRL It is often not feasible to make actual field measurements of crop damage immediately following severe weather; however noninvasive remote scanning may inform investigators of actual storm damage conditions prior to plant deterioration, possibly leading to more resilient genotypes. This approach is consistent with the general trend of developing precision technology to more efficiently grow crops while at the same time reducing adverse impacts on the environment.</AbstractNarration>

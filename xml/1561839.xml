    <AbstractNarration>Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials are a new class of materials that have shown attractive material properties with potential applications in light-conversion and information technologies. For example, 2D materials are extremely flexible due to their membrane-like thin structure, they interact with light very strongly, and their surfaces are good for sensing molecules and gases. They are currently grown in small quantities only on flat surfaces with poor optical performance which greatly limit their potential. Their successful integration into real-life applications, however, requires new scalable manufacturing technologies capable of producing high quality and high performance 2D materials in large quantities. This award will pave the way to manufacture three-dimensional (3D) networks of 2D materials by conformably coating 2D layers onto 3D substrates by scalable and cost-effective nanomanufacturing techniques. This project will allow large scale manufacturing of 2D material fibers and enable many new applications of atomically thin materials. Additionally, this project includes educational outreach, with a strong emphasis on bringing an understanding of nanoscience and 2D materials to the general public through free open house events and other activities. It will also give hands-on research opportunities to underrepresented groups and minority students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pound-for-pound atomically thin 2D materials, such as MoS2, have the potential to generate three-orders of magnitude energy compared to conventional materials such as Si or GaAs. However, when they are grown in planar form, their optical performance greatly suffers from their extreme thinness. This award tackles this problem from a nanomanufacturing point of view by constructing 3D networks of 2D materials. Deposition of 2D materials in 3D geometry has distinct advantages over planar ones as their total surface area, material quantity, and optical performance (absorption and emission) can be increased significantly. However, no systematic studies exist to date on the nanomanufacturing of 3D networks of 2D materials. The research team aims to close the knowledge gap by coating individual electrospun nanofibers with 2D sheets using a cost-effective, reliable, and scalable electrospinning process. Electrospinning is used to produce polymeric alumina nanofibers, which are then crystallized by thermal annealing into desired crystalline phases for successful 2D deposition. Lastly, 2D materials are deposited using a scalable chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Material performance of manufactured networks will be tested and techniques will be combined into traditional CVD and electrospinning techniques to realize 2D systems for practical applications.</AbstractNarration>

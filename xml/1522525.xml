    <AbstractNarration>The ability to control the transport of small molecules through very small pores in membranes is important for a variety of applications such as the development of drug delivery systems and separation techniques. An improved understanding of the fundamental chemistry that controls the transport of small molecules would have broad biomedical, biotechnology, and environmental implications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program supports the work of Professor Eugene Pinkhassik of the University of Connecticut focusing on regulating the transport of small molecules through gated nanopores and creating nanocapsules capable of rapid uptake and release of small molecules. The transport will be regulated by controlling the chemical environment of nanopores and by reversible binding of plugs or lids. This interdisciplinary project integrates research and training with outreach activities aimed at underrepresented groups in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

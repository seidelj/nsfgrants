<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Despite recent advances, women remain significantly underrepresented in physics.  This award seeks to address this issue by identifying best practices across the globe in recruiting and retaining female physicists.  To launch this effort, a U.S. delegation is attending the 6th International Union of Pure and Applied Physics International Conference on Women in Physics (ICWIP 2017) in the UK (July 2017). Strategies and insights shared during the ICWIP 2017 meeting are expected to be useful in the retention of women in physics and other physical science fields.  In addition, participation in this conference seeds international research and educational partnerships, which are also important in advancing the careers of women in science. The key benefits for U.S. scientists are maximized through the conference proceedings; effective dissemination plans; follow-up sessions at numerous U.S. venues; papers, talks, and networking by the delegates; and the development of an extensive website on gender bias. The U.S. delegation includes a few members from fields other than physics where women are scarce (e.g., engineering and computer science), thus laying the groundwork for those fields to benefit from the knowledge disseminated at this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:  This series of international conferences on women in physics is proving to be an effective mechanism for sharing best practices internationally, empowering new approaches and actions in the U.S., nucleating networking in research, and increasing the numbers, advancement and retention of women in the field. Members of the U.S. Delegation learn about and take advantage of successful initiatives piloted in ~ 50-70 other countries. Moreover, by including non-physicists as a part of those attending the conference, this model is being used to catalyze the transfer of knowledge to other fields where similar strategies could improve women's participation. Finally, the body of knowledge shared during the conference is being published in proceedings which will be freely available online.</AbstractNarration>

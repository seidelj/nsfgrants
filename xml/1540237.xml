    <AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program supports a travel award for three graduate students at US universities to participate in the 14th International Congress on Combustion By-Products and their Health Effects held June 14-17, 2015 in Umea, Sweden. The International Congress has met every two years since 1990, the Congress usually attracts between 100 and 200 delegates from all over the world. The students are selected by the Standing Organizing Committee for the conference based on need and the quality of abstracts submitted for presentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental research is interdisciplinary and this meeting brings together scientists, engineers, and health care researchers to discuss the environmental issues surrounding combustion. This meeting brings academic, government, and industrial representatives together to present research findings, update international policy, and discuss critical issues concerning emissions of toxic by-products from the combustion processes.</AbstractNarration>

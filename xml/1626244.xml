    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the acquisition of a new state of the art Laser Ablation Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer system (LA-MC-ICPMS) to be incorporated into the expanding Ken Williams Radiogenic Isotope Geosciences Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University. The instrumentation will be used by an interdisciplinary group of researchers across Texas A&amp;M University, the International Ocean Discovery Program, Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi, and Texas A&amp;M University Galveston to address transformative and interdisciplinary questions in climate, biogeochemistry, environmental change, and tectonics. Specific research topics include: 1) novel transition metal isotope measurements such as iron, zinc, and cadmium as a tracer of oceanic metal cycling; 2) understanding how isotope and trace element tracers can be used to understand the relationship between past climate change and past oceanic biological productivity, deep-ocean circulation, and patterns of continental aridity and hydrology; 3) expanding geochronology research capabilities using new methods in uranium series dating; 4) using boron and neodymium isotope measurements in carbonates to reconstruct oceanic and atmospheric circulation changes and seawater pH histories. The diverse team of early career and experienced faculty along with their students will use this instrumentation to transform our understanding of the way our planet works at the surface (biosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere) and at depth (lithosphere). We intend to engage large numbers of undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge STEM training using state-of-the-art instrumentation through both research experiences and high-impact teaching opportunities that provide hands on training in the use of clean room laboratory techniques and in the operation of the mass spectrometer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for the acquisition of a Laser Ablation Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer system (LA-MC-ICPMS) to be housed in the Ken Williams Radiogenic Isotope Geosciences Laboratory at Texas A&amp;M University. The MC-ICPMS instrument comprises an ICP source, a magnetic sector mass analyzer, and an array of multiple detectors that allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple isotopes. This static isotope ratio measurement results in a precision far superior to that obtained by sequential isotope measurement by single collector ICPMS. Laser ablation (LA) is a widely used sampling method for in-situ ICPMS analyses of solid samples that are either difficult to digest or where resolution of spatial relationships within sampled micro-domains is critical. The laser system includes the HelEx sample chamber necessary to produce stable signals and reproducible ablation effects. The instrumentation will be used by an interdisciplinary group of researchers to address questions in climate, biogeochemistry, environmental change, and tectonics. Principle investigator projects will focus on 1) novel transition metal isotope measurements as a tracer of oceanic metal cycling; 2) understanding how isotope and trace element tracers can be used to understand the relationship between past climate change and past oceanic biological productivity, deep-ocean circulation, and patterns of continental aridity and hydrology; 3) expanding geochronology research capabilities using new methods for "petrochronology" by split-stream ICPMS and trace-element screening of zircons for high-precision U-Pb dating; 4) U/Th dating and boron isotope measurements in deep-sea corals to reconstruct ocean ventilation and seawater pH histories; 5) Nd isotopes as a tracer of oceanic and atmospheric circulation.</AbstractNarration>

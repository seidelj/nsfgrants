    <AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research, together with the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, and the Office for Multidisciplinary Activities contribute funds to this award that provides support for the International Liquid Crystal Conference, which will be held at Kent State University from July 31st to August 5th 2016. This is a highly interdisciplinary meeting that brings together a diverse group of leading researchers, including scientists and engineers from academia and industry, whose work covers the range from basic science to device manufacturing. In this instance of the conference, applied mathematics is included as a session topic for the first time. The general aim of the conference will be to facilitate the exchange of ideas about current and interesting problems related to liquid crystals, to discuss recent findings and developments in the field, to determine future research directions, and to enable future collaborations among the participants. NSF support will enable the participation of 12 early-career scientists and 21 students, who might not otherwise be able to attend. Students and postdoctoral researchers will also benefit from mentorship activities during the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Division of Materials Research, together with the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems, and the Office for Multidisciplinary Activities contribute funds to this award that provides support for the International Liquid Crystal Conference, which will be held at Kent State University from July 31st to August 5th 2016.
